<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Last weekend, Clinton  called off a strike against Iraq minutes before it was to begin, delayed  his departure for Asia to monitor the crisis and said that U.S. forces  remained poised to strike if Iraq reneged on its agreement to let  U.N. weapons inspectors do their work.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>He said in a Parliament session  that one of them is believed to already be producing plutonium and  the other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs starting  around 2004.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Kim said he  asked the government's Unification Ministry about the issue earlier  this week and was suspicious of its answer.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held  a roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions  for putting the nation's economy back on track.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If true, the assertion paints a worse picture of suspected  North Korean nuclear activity than already made public.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be  producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear  facilities than already feared.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Without naming his source, Rep. Kim  Deog-ryong of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said he had  ``information'' that two underground facilities captured on U.S. spy  satellite photos may be nuclear plants.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>``It was not sufficient  or sincere, so I came to suspect that the government is trying to  hide the truth,'' Kim said in a seven-page press release.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Kim, a lawmaker from the  main opposition Grand National Party, said there may actually be two  underground facilities not far from the Yongbyon complex.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It was activity  at Yongbyon that prompted the United States to negotiate a 1994 accord  promising development of two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments  if North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>``We estimate that the reactor will go on-line in 2002 or 2003,  enabling the production of enough plutonium to build one nuclear weapon  within six to 12 months,'' Kim said.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The United States  has said it suspects the construction is nuclear-related, though it  has no evidence.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In meetings this  week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. officials were rebuffed  in their request to see the suspicious site, which American intelligence  officials fear could be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear  weapons program.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet  certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North  Korea is nuclear related.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The foundation  of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward  the South is a 1994 ``agreed framework'' in which the North halted  its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a Western commitment to  build modern nuclear energy sources there.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>President Kim  Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged to  ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve the  nuclear question.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>``North Korea would be able to  make sufficient plutonium to make eight to 10 nuclear weapons every  year after that.''</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's  support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear  site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander  a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>At the time,  North Korea was believed to have made enough plutonium for one or  two atomic bombs.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>In a statement distributed by the  U.S. embassy here today, Kartman said instead, ``There is strong information  that makes us suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the  intended purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if  so, what type of nuclear facility it might be.''</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The Clinton administration is  urgently seeking to inspect a vast construction site in North Korea  that it believes may be the beginnings of a nuclear weapons plant.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>``Nothing could ever be put in that  hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much advantage,  as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness as more of those  ships going up there full of people from here.''</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Directing  his remarks at North Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new  tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise  ships _ an arrangement touted by Kim as a sign the North may be opening  up to its 1950s Korean War enemy.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The subject of North  Korea consumed most of his two hours of meetings with Kim here Saturday  at the Blue House, which contains the Korean president's office and  home.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Clinton acknowledged  that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the underground  construction project in North Korea is nuclear related.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's  support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear  site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander  an historic chance to make a lasting peace on the peninsula.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The Clinton administration  fears that the construction site may be evidence that North Korea  has abandoned a 1994 pledge to the United States to give up its nuclear  weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>``It raises a strong suspicion,'' Clinton  said at a joint news conference with Kim at the Blue House, the presidential  mansion overlooking the capital.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Kim, who has moved South Korea to a ``sunshine'' policy of engaging  North Korea on cultural and economic fronts, was firm in saying his  government supports Clinton on the nuclear issue.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>But they have demanded that the United States pay $300 million  to inspect it, a request rejected this week by a U.S. delegation to  Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.</a>
