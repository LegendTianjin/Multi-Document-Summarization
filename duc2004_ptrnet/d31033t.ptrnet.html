<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>_ When America Online Inc., which competes  fiercely with Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions,  went shopping for browser technology, Microsoft made an offer that  was too good to pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser  as the main one for its millions of subscribers, Microsoft would give  America Online prime placement on the desktop screen of all personal  computers using Windows.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Microsoft Corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two  business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in  the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It  prodded computer makers and others to distribute its browser, folded  the browser into its industry-dominant Windows operating system and  gave the browser away free _ a campaign intended to ``cut off their  air supply,'' as a senior Microsoft executive described it.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>_ Microsoft's reach in computing has become so pervasive that nearly  every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately  with a team of top Microsoft executives to learn about the company's  plans.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>_ When Compaq Computer  Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's  on its personal computers, Microsoft threatened to stop selling its  Windows operating system to Compaq.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some of the cases recounted here figure prominently in the suit brought  by the Justice Department and 20 states, scheduled to go to trial  this month, charging that Microsoft at times went too far _ and violated  antitrust laws.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity  for entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip on the  personal computer software business.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It dispatched hundreds of programmers to work on a competing  browser and poured many millions of dollars into marketing it.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A close look at  Microsoft's no-holds-barred push into the Internet software business  offers a window into the ways the company uses its market muscle to  influence the behavior of virtually every player in the industry.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In its suit, the government  asserts that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled  together to get an unfair edge over its rival, Netscape Communications  Corp., in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World  Wide Web.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>But not  only competitors like Netscape have encountered Microsoft's force.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The government's case  focuses on an earlier deal in March 1996, when America Online chose  Internet Explorer as its preferred browser; in that bargain Microsoft  agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main  Windows desktop screen _ the prime real estate in computing.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>``It seems to me that this debate over Netscape's mistakes  is a total sideshow,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official  in the Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now at the  Brookings Institution.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's  restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and  Its Battle with Microsoft,'' the authors, Michael A. Cusumano of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management  and David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a Microsoft  executive as saying that only with the third version of Microsoft's  browser was it integrated with Windows.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in Silicon  Valley.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Leading the challenge was Netscape  Communications Corp., whose software for browsing the World Wide Web  had ignited the Internet boom.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>He borrowed imagery from the  movie ``Star Wars,'' referring to Microsoft as the Death Star and  Netscape as the leader of a rebel alliance.</a>
