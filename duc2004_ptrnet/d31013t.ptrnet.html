<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>All the letters appear to be hoaxes,  and it remains unclear whether they were connected to any of the five  shootings.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked  to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day  to commemorate aborted fetuses.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>U.S. and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked  to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York,  including the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home near  Buffalo.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>While many _ including Mrs. Hayes _ disavow violent tactics, supporters  of abortion rights say that people like her bear some responsibility  when the protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Many women's  clinics have tightened security, and doctors who provide abortions  have been urged to take precautions.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>While veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday  to honoring fallen soldiers, Remembrance Day has become a chilling  vigil for Canadians in the front lines of the abortion-rights movement.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>There is immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman is believed  to be at large.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>And there is long-term anxiety, because even in this  country where abortions are legal and publicly funded, women may find  access diminishing.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Three times since 1994, a sniper has  used this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor  who performs abortion, each time wounding the target.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>``You must realize Canada has the largest undefended  border in the world,'' said Keith McCaskill, a police inspector in  Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman for the investigation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Across  Canada, there have been reports of obstetrician-gynecologists modifying  their practices or deciding to stop performing abortions.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Police say they don't know which  side of the border he is on, fueling uneasiness at clinics and hospitals  throughout Canada.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Members  of the Lambs of Christ have been persistent figures in protests at  the Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked before  he was shot to death last month.</a>
