<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Ten  of the 11 countries adopting the euro dropped their interest rate  to 3 percent.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In a surprise move, nations adopting the new European currency, the  euro, dropped key interest rates Thursday, effectively setting the  rate that will be adopted throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Duisenberg, who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and Dec.  22 meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the  outlook for inflation and the EU economy.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>While inflation is at its lowest levels in decades _ just 1  percent in the euro-zone _ unemployment in the 11 nations remains  stubbornly high at 10.9 percent.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>``The joint reduction in interest rates  has to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates  with which the (bank) will start ... monetary union,'' the statement  said, adding the 3-percent rate would be maintained ``for the foreseeable  future.''</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Duisenberg has said growth in  the euro area countries next year will be about 2.5 percent, lower  than the 3 percent predicted earlier.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In his most candid remarks yet on the economy, European Central Bank  President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing  in the 11 countries adopting the EU common currency _ or euro _ on  Jan. 1.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>He pointed also to a gradual improvement in  labor market conditions as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate  cuts toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate countries.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The bank, which will set  monetary policy for the currency bloc, has been under pressure from  politicians to keep interest rates low to help boost growth and create  jobs.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Setting a common  interest rates had been a particularly contentious issue as center-left  governments in Germany and France pressed for lower rates to help  boost growth and cut unemployment, a stubborn 10.9 percent in the  euro zone.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>European Central Bank chief, Wim Duisenberg, gave no hint  of the rate cuts during a speech in Brussels earlier Thursday, instead  suggesting that governments should reform rigid labor markets to create  jobs.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Despite an area-wide survey that suggested ``a moderation  in the pace of growth,'' Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue  to boost the economy.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In Germany, the biggest economy in the future euro-zone, central  bankers cut the key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.3 percent.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying  the groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expected  rates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent before  the cut, now 3 percent.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the  move reflected the worsening outlook for European economies, and wasn't  a capitulation to political pressure Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The governing council comprises the 11 heads of  national central banks plus a six-member directorate, including the  bank president Duisenberg.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>However, interest rate levels had become a  contentious political issue with center-left governments in Germany  and France pushing for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment,  stuck at 10.9 percent in the nations adopting the euro.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>``The coordinated rate  cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction  in financial market turbulence,'' he said.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>It wasn't in response to political pressure,''  Tietmeyer said, referring to Germany's cut.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Making their first collective decision about monetary policy, the  11 European nations launching a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest  rates Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Hans  Tietmeyer, who runs the German Bundesbank on which the ECB is modeled,  hinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in the new currency,  dampened by global economic crises and Europe's worsening outlook.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>By making it cheaper to borrow  money, rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses, making  it less worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>A poll published last October showed 46 percent  of Danes favored the single currency, while 44 percent were opposed.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Ten  of the 11 countries joining European economic union dropped their  key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most significant  plunge, from 3.75 percent.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Frankfurt's main  index closed up 2.1 percent, while France's was up 1.8 percent.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>But just two days ago, Duisenberg  painted the bleakest picture yet of Europe's economies, warning growth  will likely slow to 2.5 percent next year from earlier expectations  of 3 percent.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>But Tietmeyer, head of  the bank on which the ECB is modeled, promised that the rate cut does  not signal the start of a volatile monetary policy.</a>
