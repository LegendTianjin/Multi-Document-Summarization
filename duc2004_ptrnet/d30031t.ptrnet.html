<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The planet's most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle  Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S.-built  part of an international space station that is expected to cost more  than $100 billion.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While  putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station  would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old  outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on,  said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The shuttle contains  the second station component.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour  on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research equipment to  use on the international space station, he said, but only if it does  not interfere with assembling the new station.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The master alarm blared and red lights  flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>By  the time controllers traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic  pressure and decided to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed  the cutoff by a second or two.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>But NASA was confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would  behave; it went off with just 4{ minutes to go in the countdown Thursday,  forcing a delay.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill  Readdy, shuttle program director and a veteran shuttle commander.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>``Amen,'' replied  a launch controller.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Rain and cloudy skies were once again a threat.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first  piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control  module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>NASA engineers spent the day examining  the problem, but found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were  confident it would not reoccur.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The United States and  15 other nations plan to begin building the new station in orbit next  week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and  propulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>NASA was  surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed  the orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch  of the first part of the new station.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Mission Control ordered the pilots to  fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour  and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the  orbiting debris.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Rain and  clouds moved in from the Atlantic 1{ hours before liftoff, but drifted  away with minutes to spare.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The  240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy  Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle  robot arm.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Endeavour's flight is already a year  late because of a cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in  building the international space station.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The two station pieces are so  big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined  mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her crewmates were going to  have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather  than direct line of sight.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>But by then it was too late: time had run out for  one of the procedures needed to keep the shuttle's fuel supercold.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Everything had been going  smoothly for a rare nighttime launching, set for 3:58 on Thursday  morning.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The pressure dropped just  long enough to trigger the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive  switch, then returned to normal.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy  Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle  robot arm.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>On their 12-day flight,  Endeavour's astronauts are to locate a Russian part already in orbit,  grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new U.S. module.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Before beginning  their final approach to Zarya _ Russian for Sunrise _ the shuttle's  six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched  last month from California.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time  for the tasks.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>``Great show, Endeavour,'' mission control  in Houston radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle went into  orbit.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The bigger worry, by  far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling  with Unity.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been  assigned to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya,  a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on  Nov. 20.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>In case  Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking  astronauts would have to manually fit them together.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>At the same time, the station's  costs are rising, and its critics among scientists worry that its  appetite for money will consume their own federal financing.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>The project entails high risk, because of the technical difficulty  of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space,  along with the dangers inherent in flying the space shuttle to the  construction site.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Mission Control ordered the pilots  to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between  Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles  from the orbiting debris.</a>
