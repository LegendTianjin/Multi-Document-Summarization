<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The second week of the trial  ended with the prosecutors being frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination  by Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time for the government to show  several hours of a videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft  chairman.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Justice Department and the 20 states suing Microsoft  believe that the tape will strengthen their case because it shows  Gates saying he was not involved in plans to take what the government  alleges were illegal steps to stifle competition in the Internet software  market.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The e-mail record,  the government insists, shows Gates waist-deep in plotting the anti-competitive  deals and bullying tactics that he denies or professes to have never  heard of in his taped deposition.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Gates videotape, said David Boies, the Justice Department's  trial lawyer, offers an ``opportunity to judge Gates' credibility.''</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These  interrogations have two refrains: Isn't it true your company does  exactly what you are accusing Microsoft of doing, and isn't it true  that Microsoft prevailed not because it is a predatory monopolist  but because of its superior technology?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It showed a few brief clips of a point  in the deposition when Gates was asked about a meeting on June 21,  1995, at which, the government alleges, Microsoft offered to divide  the browser market with Netscape and to make an investment in the  company, which is its chief rival in that market.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>``I urge your honor,'' John Warden, Microsoft's  lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, ``to view with considerable  skepticism the crazy quilt of e-mail fragments that seem to form the  core of the government's case.''</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>But the Gates credibility gap, if there is one, becomes an issue not  because of the videotape but because his taped remarks can be compared  and contrasted with the e-mail he wrote and received.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>That division of labor, Case wrote, would be the best way to achieve  the goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described in  an earlier e-mail as beating ``the Beast From Redmond that wants to  see us both dead'' _ a reference to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond,  Wash. Printouts of e-mail are just another form of written communication.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a striking  degree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off,  but one thing is already clear: This is the first major e-mail trial.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>With a new witness, an executive of Apple Computer Inc.,  taking the stand Monday, it is uncertain when the Gates tape will  be played.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>``The  government does not need to put Gates on the stand, because we have  his e-mail and memoranda,'' Stephen Houck, a lawyer for the states,  told the court.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>If his machinations are central  to the government's case, why not summon Gates to the trial?</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>But as part  of the deal, AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development  partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business  of selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to  serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands  of users at the same time.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>And e-mail, they add, has played an important  role in legal inquiries for years, like the Iran-contra case in the  1980s when e-mail found in Oliver North's computer proved crucial.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Warden's cross-examination  ritual is to present a government witness with an internal e-mail  from his company and then pose a declaration as a question.</a>
