<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The injured toll was lowered slightly to 180, but included seven people  who needed treatment at emergency burn centers.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an upstairs hall planning to dance  the night away, but by the time the sun rose Friday they were dead,  clinging to life in hospitals or weeping in disbelief at a fire that  killed 67 of them.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``We are still searching the building  ... but so far we have found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan  Edmundson said on national radio.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween  revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring  about 180.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local  rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio, describing  the sight when rescuers first entered the building in Goteborg, a  city of half a million people on the country's west coast.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The fire  was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people  died in the town of Boraas.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>He said he raced  in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>At a news conference Friday morning,  police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Jamal  Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the blaze  started with about 400 people inside.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>``A night full of  expectation, happiness over extra leave from school and high spirits  in anticipation of a weekend was brutally and suddenly changed into  a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council  said in a statement.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The fast-spreading fire completely  gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that  local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The  fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in building of the  local Macedonian Association, which organized the dance.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The crowd  in the second story of the building contained mostly 13 to 18 year  olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>His skin was red and bubbly,'' Atta said.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Bent metal  bars on some of the hall's windows showed the panic-fueled strength  that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants, exerted as they sought  ways out of the hall, which with some 400 people inside was crowded  to more than twice its legal capacity.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims  choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found  at the scene and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials said.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with  youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling  with police to get in and attempt to help friends.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The blaze was already consuming the two-story  brick building.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m.  (2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes  later, rescue workers said.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Binan Atta was walking  to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor,  where the dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant  association in Sweden's second-largest city.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency  services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took  three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where  to send fire trucks.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Police said another 173 people were injured, 20  of them severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick  two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a boisterous  disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of moments.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey  at the bash, told of his ordeal in telegraphic bursts.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>The 60th victim died at a hospital.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Although Hersi, like many of  the youths at the dance, believes the police and firemen were slow,  authorities said the first fire trucks were on the scene within five  minutes of getting the alarm.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the  dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for  a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, the detective leading  the disaster investigation.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Fire Brigade  Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames' quick, raging spread could  indicate arson, or that the fire had burned undetected for a time  before exploding.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Police  rescued 40, and recovered 59 bodies.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friends  are dead,'' 17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined  building Friday afternoon.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>``His  clothes had burned off.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers  into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180  in Sweden's second-largest city.</a>
