<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This police officer, who is apparently one of a small group  of ethnic Albanians officers who have remained loyal to the Serbs,  could be an important witness for criminal investigators from the  war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, according to human rights experts.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Last week, it also refused  to allow U.N. investigators to probe alleged atrocities in Serbia's  southern Kosovo province where ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting  government forces.</a>
