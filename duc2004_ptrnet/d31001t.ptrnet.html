<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The conference, organized by the Medical Research Council, is examining  mental health issues raised by the Truth Commission, which is charged  with probing crimes committed by all sides in the anti-apartheid struggle.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Many  whites see the panel as favoring the black liberation movements, while  many blacks accuse it of being too soft on former state officials,  especially top ranking ministers.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Many of Thursday's speakers touched on the figure of police  death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who was given jail terms totaling  more than 200 years after a killing spree that costs dozens of lives.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As the commission prepares to hand over its final report at the end  of the month, South Africans are examining its painful and traumatic  exploration of their bloody past.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Torturers and bombers who carried out atrocities defending or fighting  apartheid need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crimes,  an expert for South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The report was expected to place overwhelming  blame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal security  services.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Addressing  local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research  head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the  psychological needs of those who carried out human rights abuses could  alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, Villa-Vicencio appealed  for tolerance in dealing with all those who have committed crimes,  saying that the potential for wrongdoing existed in everyone.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>``We  all, the entire human race, carry with us the capacity for evil,''  he said.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>``Many people have found him in interviews to be an ordinary, even  likeable person,'' he said about the man whom subordinates dubbed  ``Prime Evil.''</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Dan Stein, a specialist  in neurobiology and stress disorders, said de Kock typified many killers  from all sides in the conflict by his sheer ``banality of evil''.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>After describing how she hugged the three members of the black nationalist  Pan-Africanist Congress and urged them to seek counseling together  with their victims, Fourie earned a standing ovation from the 50-strong  audience.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Struggling to control her tears, Fourie told delegates  she had attended the amnesty hearings of her daughter's killers and  supported their successful bid to be freed from long jail sentences.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>De Kock has applied for amnesty for his crimes.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>With the power to grant amnesty  to many who tortured, bombed or maimed innocent civilians, the process  has at some stage angered people in nearly all walks of life.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>``We must give  attention to the healing of perpetrators, not just for the sake of  perpetrators, but for the sake of the nation as a whole,'' he said.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Ginn Fourie, a physiotherapist whose student daughter  was gunned down by black activists in a 1993 attack on a Cape Town  bar, said it was necessary to help those whose circumstances compelled  them to do wrong.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National  Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks,  the state broadcaster said Monday.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said  he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in  advance ``informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross  human rights violations.''</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>It said the party must accept responsibility  for the activities of ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,  Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club,  accused of killings, torture and kidnappings.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been  leaked a ``preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically  and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and  after the fall of apartheid.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>President Nelson Mandela's office received an advance copy  on Monday ahead of the handover ceremony, when retired Archbishop  Desmond Tutu, who chaired the comission, will present Mandela with  the report.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the  planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military camps  in Angola and bombings.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman,  said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge,  and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying  its release.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>The institution exploring apartheid's horrors will issue a report  that finds the African National Congress shares blame for human rights  violations as it struggled to overcome white rule.</a>

<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The commission also  said the PAC was guilty of the deaths of civilians in its strategy  in 1993 to drive white farmers off their land so it could be reclaimed  by blacks.</a>
