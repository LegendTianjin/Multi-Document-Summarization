<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The  disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclosed  in ``Rollcall,'' a Capitol Hill newspaper, sent a new jolt of uncertainty  among lawmakers as they prepared for the momentous debate over the  president's admitted misbehavior in office and whether he should be  impeached and tried by the Senate.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Democrats offered  no immediate comment, but Republicans were braced to hear Livingston's  admissions alluded to in the debate Friday by Democrats who have decried  the investigation of the president as basically a partisan and unfair  rummaging through his sex life.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The president  is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of  power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But he attempted to draw a contrast with  the allegations against the president, asserting: ``I want to assure  everyone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff  and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them.''</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>After hearing his admissions in a  closed session, Livingston's colleagues gave him a standing ovation  of support and said the question of his resigning had never arisen.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of  shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday  night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican  colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>``It has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals  working together with the media who are investigating my personal  background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable  against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on  impeachment,'' Livingston declared in a statement after appearing  before a shocked House Republican conference to head off the disclosure  as it surfaced in news reports.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The debate over the president's fate  would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions  between the speaker-elect's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity  scandal that has put Clinton on the brink of impeachment.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual  counseling and had received the forgiveness of his family, noted he  had several times told reporters during his campaign to become speaker  that ``I was running for speaker, not sainthood.''</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Then, as on Thursday night,  Republicans voiced suspicions that Democratic defenders of the president  instigated media investigations in an effort to embarrass the Clinton's  principal accusers.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For, with the impeachment issue set to move to the Senate,  Livingston, whose own marital indiscretions were now before the public  to his obvious misery, chose to show how the question of a political  leader's resignation was very much in play in this tumult-tossed city.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican  chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who is to bring the impeachment  charges against the president, previously was cited by a magazine  for an extra-marital affair in his past.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>He would not confirm whether the firm is Terry  Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which has done work for the president's  private lawyers.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>``During my 33-year marriage to my  wife, Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing  so nearly cost me my marriage and family,'' Livingston said in his  brief prepared statement.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>``But the president's continued failure to come  to grips with his actions, the sincerity and arguments of members  of the Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle, the change  of heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who originally  opposed impeachment and who now support it, and the strong and powerful  opinion of so many of my constituents who oppose my position and who  wanted the president impeached caused me to rethink my position.''</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>``It breaks your heart because  we're all subject to human frailties,'' said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.,  as he left the conference.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler, earlier this year advertised an  offer of a $1 million bounty for information about e of members of  Congress guilty of sexual indiscretions.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>``We're not going to say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated  your vows with your wife,''' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Like  many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct  from Clinton's by saying that the president had ``trampled'' on the  legal system whereas Livingston's behavior was strictly private.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Some guessed, or hoped, that the results of the recent poll, which  showed increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the  nation a trial in which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star  witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve.</a>
