<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The number of  players making $1 million to $2 million a year _ the middle class,  in NBA terms _ fell sharply.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The main sticking point has been the owners' insistence on a salary  cap without exceptions, the implementation of which they believe would  bring player salaries' in line with revenue growth.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's  no guarantee that it will end the lockout.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the players win, the owners will be liable for about  dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed  to appeal if they lose.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association  and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether  more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during  the lockout.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>``If we win, I think it just emboldens the  spirit and resolve of the players,'' union director Billy Hunter said.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The sides  have not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union proposed a  superstar tax on the highest contracts.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The league already has sued the players over  Feerick's jurisdiction.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>``It only means they have  to pay some 200 players, and they've indicated to us their intent  to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in  order to avoid payment.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Hunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday afternoon,  then said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick's ruling.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>``We've got to get a sense  of where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and  what they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence,''  Hunter said.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The Sacramento  Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract  in 1994, and it was approved by the league.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The league also called former union  director Simon Gourdine to testify, but Feerick upheld union objections  and prohibited Gourdine from saying whether it was his understanding  when he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would  not be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose  a lockout.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In a six-day hearing over the summer,  the union argued that owners should have protected themselves from  being liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting  lockout language into the standard player contract.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The players aren't going to get paid Nov.  15 in any circumstance,'' Hunter said.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>If the players win, the owners will be liable for about  dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed  to appeal if they lose.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Hunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday afternoon,  then said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick's ruling.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>It's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, since the union  is holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee  in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>``It only means they have  to pay some 200 players, and they've indicated to us their intent  to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in  order to avoid payment.</a>

<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>If the owners win, it will  remove the last wild card the players had been holding.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Added Stern, ``We owe it to the fans to  go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve  the result we wanted.</a>
