<s id="s0">Undervaluing Royal Mail shares cost taxpayers £750m in one day</s>
<s id="s1">The government 's desperation to sell Royal Mail cost taxpayers £750m in a single day , the National Audit Office has said in a scathing report into the privatisation of the 500-year-old national institution . </s>
<s id="s2">The public spending watchdog says the business secretary Vince Cable ploughed ahead with plans to float Royal Mail at a maximum price of 330p-a-share despite repeated warnings from City experts that the government had vastly undervalued the company . </s>
<s id="s3">The audit office said in a report today that Cable chose not to heed the warnings and increase the flotation price from the 260-330p range because of fears it could put off institutional investors and jeopardise the flotation as postal workers were preparing for nationwide strike action . </s>
<s id="s4">The watchdog said the business department 's keen desire to achieve a successful sale of Royal Mail within this parliament "resulted in the shares being priced at a level substantially below that at which they started trading " . </s>
<s id="s5">Royal Mail 's shares spiked 38 % on their debut on the stock market on 11 October - the biggest one-day rise in a privatisation since British Airways in 1987 - as investors tried to buy up more than 23 times the number of shares available . </s>
<s id="s6">The audit office said the government could have made an additional £750m for taxpayers if it had priced the sale at the first day closing price of 455p rather than the maximum 330p starting price . </s>
<s id="s7">Achieving an additional £750m from the sale could have covered the annual salaries of an additional 34,000 NHS nurses . </s>
<s id="s8">The early jump in the share price , dismissed by Cable as "froth and speculation " was followed by a continued rise to a peak of 618p in January . </s>
<s id="s9">The shares closed at 563p yesterday , still 70 % higher than the float price . </s>
<s id="s10">Amyas Morse , head of the audit office , said : " The department was very keen to achieve its objective of selling Royal Mail , and was successful in getting the company listed on the FTSE 100 . </s>
<s id="s11">Its approach , however , was marked by deep caution , the price of which was borne by the taxpayer . </s>
<s id="s12">" Cable said : " Achieving the highest price possible at any cost and whatever the risk was never the aim of the sale . </s>
<s id="s13">The report concludes there was a real risk of a failed sale attached to pushing the price too high . </s>
<s id="s14">And a failed sale would have been the worst outcome for taxpayers and jeopardised the operation of Royal Mail . </s>
<s id="s15">" The audit office said the government 's pricing decision was largely influenced by Cable 's desire for "long-term , blue chip " institutional investors to buy and hold large chunks of Royal Mail shares . </s>
<s id="s16">Despite overwhelming public demand for the shares ( the public ordered enough to own the whole of the postal service but were cut down to just £750 per person ) , Cable allowed 16 long-term investors , mostly pension funds , priority access to the shares . </s>
<s id="s17">The audit office said this was part of the government 's "expectation that they would form part of a stable long-term and supportive shareholder base " . </s>
<s id="s18">At the time , Cable said : " We wanted to make sure that the company started its new life with a core of high quality investors who would be there in good times and bad , interested in Royal Mail and the universal service it provides for consumers over the long term . </s>
<s id="s19">" However , the audit office said six of the 16 "priority investors " selected by Cable had sold all of their allocation within weeks of the float , at a substantial profit . </s>
<s id="s20">The watchdog said that by the end of January 2014 just 12 % of the company 's shares were held by the "priority investors " . </s>
<s id="s21">A large proportion of their shares were gobbled up by hedge funds , which Cable has repeatedly attacked for being short term investors , describing them as " spivs and gamblers " . </s>
<s id="s22">Within a fortnight of the float , a London hedge fund whose boss was memorably described as a "locust " by German politicians , bought up so many shares that it became Royal Mail 's second-biggest investor after the government , which retained a 30 % stake . </s>
<s id="s23">The Children 's Investment Fund , which is run by billionaire Chris Hohn , bought up 5.8 % of the shares . </s>
<s id="s24">It has since cut its stake down below 5 % . </s>
<s id="s25">The audit office also criticised the government for relying too heavily on its advisers , predominately the investment bank Lazard . </s>
<s id="s26">The watchdog said the government gave Lazard an incentive " solely to complete a transaction " – not to achieve the maximum value for taxpayers . </s>
<s id="s27">" The taxpayer interest was not clearly prioritised within the structure of the independent adviser 's role , " the audit office said in its report . </s>
<s id="s28">And it revealed that the government asked its advisers if it should increase the offer price in the days before the float . </s>
<s id="s29">The department 's banking advisers said the top of the price range could be increased by 20p to 350p - which would have made an extra £120m for taxpayers . </s>
<s id="s30">However , Lazards and the banks advised against increasing the price for fear it could have put off investors . </s>
<s id="s31">This was despite some of the banking syndicate 's analysts valuing the shares as high as 510p , with no one reckoning they were worth less than 300p . </s>
<s id="s32">Lazards advised selling the shares at between 212-262p . </s>
<s id="s33">Lazard was paid £1.5m for its advice . </s>
<s id="s34">The government spent a total of £12.7m on fees to bankers , including UBS , Goldman Sachs , Barclays and Merrill Lynch , accountants , lawyers and PR advisers . </s>
<s id="s35">Margaret Hodge , chair of the public accounts committee , said the department for business made a " critical error by incentivising its private advisers to sell the shares on time at the expense of price " . </s>
<s id="s36">She said the 70 % rise in Royal Mail 's share price since flotation shows that the department "had no clue what it was doing" . </s>
<s id="s37">Hodge said she was looking forward to "discussing this second class performance " when the department gives evidence to the committee in May . </s>
<s id="s38">Chuka Umunna , the shadow business secretary , said the audit office 's report was a "damning verdict on the Tory-led government 's botched Royal Mail fire sale , leaving the taxpayer disgracefully short changed by hundreds of millions of pounds " . </s>
<s id="s39">Billy Hayes , general secretary of the Communication Workers Union that represents postmen and women , said the report "finds the government guilty "of overseeing a "get rich quick " scheme which offered no value to taxpayers . </s>
<s id="s40">Unite national officer Brian Scott said : " This report is startling proof that the government sold off the country 's family silver on the cheap . " </s>
