<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thursday, with pressure building to resolve the spending bills  before Oct. 9, when temporary financing of the government expires,  the negotiators agreed to include the contraceptive measure in their  conference report on the $13.4 billion bill for the Treasury Department  and Postal service.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>And many male members of Congress seemed  persuaded to support coverage of contraceptives for women, since almost  all of the 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, the male impotency  drug.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who pushed the contraceptive  measure through the House, hailed Thursday's agreement as the first  major accomplishment by abortion rights advocates since the Republicans  took control of Congress in 1994.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The contraceptive measure would require the federal health plans,  which affect 1.2 million female federal employees who are of child-bearing  age, to cover the five methods of contraception that have been approved  by the Food and Drug Administration for use in this country _ birth  control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to require most federal  health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, giving  an unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocates of abortion rights.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>But the opponents of abortion were furious about the approval  and persuaded Republican leaders to have negotiators reopen discussion  on the matter.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Currently, only 19 percent of federal health plans cover those methods.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>That provision would require a four-vote majority among the seven  federal election commissioners every four years to retain the general  counsel and staff director.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Congress has passed only six of the 13 required  spending bills and are negotiating now with the White House on a final  omnibus package that will contain the remaining seven bills and major  issues including how to conduct the census in the year 2000, how much  money to provide the International Monetary Fund and under what conditions  it should be provided, and how much emergency money to provide for  items like increased security at U.S. embassies around the world and  for American farmers.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>But the future of the measure was in doubt because it was attached  to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision regarding  the Federal Election Commission.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>She said the negotiators had agreed  to include the measure because in an election year they did not want  to be perceived as opposing contraception or be seen as rejecting  a measure that had passed both the House and Senate.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The cost of contraceptives has driven up the out-of-pocket  cost of health care for women.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>But with President Clinton likely to veto  the measure, the final outcome may depend on whether its sponsors  can insert the road proposal into a huge spending bill that is likely  to emerge just before Congress heads home for the Nov. 3 elections.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The provision is aimed at getting rid  of Lawrence Noble, the current general counsel, who has investigated  the campaign finance practices of groups like the Christian Coalition.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Stevens  said in angry tones Thursday that two-thirds of Alaska's land was  off limits to development and that vital health services were being  denied to his state's residents.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Opponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable precedent  that threatens the seasonal breeding grounds of protected migratory  birds, and they say that improved air or sea service would be a better  alternative.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>That provision could scuttle the  spending bill, which would finance the Treasury Department and the  Postal Service and which still must be approved by the House and Senate.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The House and Senate approved the contraceptive measure earlier this  year.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Without the  road, its backers say, about 700 residents of King Cove must continue  to use unreliable air and boat service in emergencies, often risking  dangerous winds and seas as they seek medical evacuation to Anchorage.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The three other bills that are stalled  in part because of abortion-related matters include the agriculture  bill, in which there is a dispute over whether the federal Food and  Drug Administration should use taxpayer money to approve drugs like  RU-486, which induce abortions.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Top-level budget negotiators for congressional Republicans and the  White House concluded yet another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon  with plans to resume talks on Monday morning and probably extend their  midnight Monday deadline for another day or two.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Sunday's discussions focused  on education and President Clinton's request for $1.1 billion to hire  100,000 teachers, but aides said the bargainers did not delve into  much detail and nothing was resolved.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Voting mainly on party lines on a question that has become a touchstone  in the debate over development and preservation of wilderness, the  Senate on Thursday approved a gravel road through remote wildlife  habitat in Alaska.</a>
