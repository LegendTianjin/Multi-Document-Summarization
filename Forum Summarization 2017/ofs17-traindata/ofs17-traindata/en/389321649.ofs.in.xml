<s id="s0">Chelsea and Norwich City frustrated by each other and referee</s>
<s id="s1">This was a result which effectively put paid to both these sides &apos; lingering hopes this term . </s>
<s id="s2">The Chelsea squad returned to the turf for their &quot;parade of appreciation &quot; with enthusiasm in short supply , an uninspiring goalless stalemate having surely confirmed José Mourinho &apos;s oft-stated conviction that the title is beyond this team . </s>
<s id="s3">They are a club already turning attention to a summer of significant tweaks to their personnel . </s>
<s id="s4">For Norwich , despite a draw which would normally provoke some satisfaction and , indeed , earned a rapturous ovation from the travelling support , the immediate future is grim . </s>
<s id="s5">The first reward of Neil Adams &apos; interim stewardship has most likely come too late to save City . </s>
<s id="s6">The visitors departed still two points below the cut-off and their relegation can effectively be confirmed on Wednesday night if Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion , the two teams immediately above them , play out a draw on Wearside . </s>
<s id="s7">This may have been admirable and they can cling to the hope that Albion and Swansea prevail this week at the Stadium of Light but , as Michael Turner admitted in the aftermath , &quot; We probably needed all three points . </s>
<s id="s8">if I &apos;m honest . </s>
<s id="s9">&quot; A three-year stint among the elite appears to be drawing to a close . </s>
<s id="s10">The visitors had competed well for long periods , almost uncharacteristically at times given the abject results which had dragged them into the mire , albeit against lacklustre hosts whose energy appeared to have fizzled out in the wake of midweek elimination in the semi-finals of the Champions League and with others boasting the advantage in the title race . </s>
<s id="s11">André Schürrle and David Luiz each struck the woodwork , the latter having been introduced at the interval along with Eden Hazard in a desperate attempt to enliven proceedings . </s>
<s id="s12">But there was too much stodginess to Chelsea &apos;s play , too little zest against opponents who , belatedly , had found some resolve on the road with this their first point in nine games away from Carrow Road . </s>
<s id="s13">The hosts mustered 23 shots but only four were on target . </s>
<s id="s14">Mourinho fidgeted frustratedly in his technical area , his mood darkened when Ryan Bennett swung his leg to challenge Hazard in the area with the Belgian leaping to avoid the limb and tumbling to the turf as a result . </s>
<s id="s15">The referee , Neil Swarbrick , ignored the penalty appeals while Mourinho scuttled off to the manager &apos;s room to watch a rerun on television before returning pitchside to make his view clear to the fourth official . </s>
<s id="s16">&quot; I went back to the dugout laughing , laughing because I ca n&apos;t cry , &quot; the Portuguese said . </s>
<s id="s17">Asked to elaborate he declined to speak more . </s>
<s id="s18">&quot; I &apos;m sorry . </s>
<s id="s19">My assistant is in jail [Rui Faria started a six-match stadium ban here ] and I do n&apos;t want to talk . </s>
<s id="s20">&quot; There might have been another had Turner been penalised for a barge on Demba Ba though , in truth , the visitors had as much cause to feel aggrieved with a non-award of their own , 11 minutes in , when Bradley Johnson &apos;s pass reached Martin Olsson . </s>
<s id="s21">If Ashley Cole had made faint contact with the ball as he slid in , John Terry at his back certainly did not with the referee &apos;s view perhaps obscured by Cole &apos;s initial challenge . </s>
<s id="s22">&quot; I &apos;ve had a look and it &apos;s pretty clear , &quot; Adams said . </s>
<s id="s23">&quot; Martin gets a touch to take it away from Ashley Cole , and John Terry &apos;s momentum just takes him out . </s>
<s id="s24">Probably [a red card ] but definitely a penalty . </s>
<s id="s25">&quot; Swarbrick opted against either , much to the visitors &apos; disgust . </s>
<s id="s26">Olsson &apos;s delivery was dangerous at times in that opening period , the Swede flinging over crosses which fizzed through the six-yard box , but one of this team &apos;s problems has been converting such opportunities . </s>
<s id="s27">They have scored 28 goals this season and their lone forward here , Johan Elmander , has only one in the league . </s>
<s id="s28">The veteran worked hard before fatigue took over , with Nathan Redmond &apos;s pace introduced in the hope Chelsea chased the game themselves and left space to exploit on the counter . </s>
<s id="s29">That might have been a masterstroke when the England Under-21 international slipped Robert Snodgrass through on goal 19 minutes from time , only for a heavy touch and Gary Cahill &apos;s excellent challenge to suffocate the shot into the side-netting . </s>
<s id="s30">With that probably went Norwich &apos;s best chance of mounting their great escape , though they appeared the more satisfied afterwards , even if they remained cautious in the dying moments when they might have pursued a winner . </s>
<s id="s31">&quot; But if we &apos;d lost , we were down , &quot; Adams said . </s>
<s id="s32">&quot; With Chelsea needing to win as well , we thought there may be opportunities to get at them with our pace . </s>
<s id="s33">Those last five minutes , do we gamble ? </s>
<s id="s34">Do we go for it ? </s>
<s id="s35">That was our dilemma . </s>
<s id="s36">As it is , we need results . </s>
<s id="s37">We need a bit of luck . </s>
<s id="s38">If it goes our way , we have to make sure that Sunday &apos;s game against Arsenal is a fantastic occasion . </s>
<s id="s39">&quot; Chelsea go to relegated Cardiff for what is likely to be a low-key and subdued occasion . </s>
<s id="s40">The emotion displayed by Cole , Frank Lampard and Terry after this game , whether some or all of that trio sign on for another year , was a reminder that this squad is still evolving . </s>
<s id="s41">This year they came close . </s>
<s id="s42">Next season they must secure tangible rewards . </s>

<s id="s98">The farcical situation is that the team he wanted to go to so badly that he spent weeks kissing every OT arse he could think of ( both before and after the CL meeting ) decided instead to employ a man whose complete previous managerial experience had been gained at world football powerhouses Preston and Everton , a career that had seen a return of one trophy ( his Preston team won the old third division ) , while the man Chelsea really wanted sensibly decided he would n’t touch them with a bargepole – forcing them to make do with a Real Madrid cast off instead . </s>
