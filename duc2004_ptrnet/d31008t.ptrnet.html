<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>``Matthew's  death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper understanding  of hate crime laws,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of  the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights group that has  250,000 members.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson,  21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on charges of kidnapping,  aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Laramie police say the primary motive was robbery,  although court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality  may also have been a factor.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On  Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in a coma  in critical condition.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied  at a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United  States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his  father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Set in a treeless  landscape defined by barbed wire fences, grazing cattle and a busy  freight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup trucks outnumber  sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolves around this  Saturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season  in the nearby Medicine Bow mountains.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Shepard's friends call the attack a hate  crime.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>But when he stopped, he found the burned,  battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay  college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Beating him inside the truck, the  pair drove him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural  subdivision, the County Attorney's report charged.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>``He indicated  he was gay, and they said they were gay, too.''</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>``This University of Wyoming student was beaten  and left to die, tied to a fence like an animal because he was honest  and open about being gay,'' Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the  Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Monday, ``Matthew Shepard's  horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply as the fault  of deranged, isolated individuals.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>``The best way to characterize  that is by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened  homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the packing  plant.''</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to  a ranch fence was a scarecrow.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The police  commander said that the two women helped the two men dump their bloody  clothing, and that they reported hearing the men make anti-gay remarks.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home.</a>
