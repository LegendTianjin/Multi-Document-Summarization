<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia  in New York last week following reports of a massacre of dozens of  East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In response, Portugal's Foreign  Ministry accused Indonesia of breaking promises to reduce its military  presence in East Timor and called for a permanent U.N. mission in  the disputed territory.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But Ramos-Horta's previous persona  non grata status had been ordered lifted by the Foreign Ministry in  August, leaving no reason why he should have been refused entry by  airport immigration when he came to town Wednesday night, ministry  spokesman Roy Wu told a news conference.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo,  has said that between 30 and 40 people were reportedly killed near  the villages of Alas and Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast  of Dili, East Timor capital.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The group  earlier had spent one night occupying the provincial Parliament and  vowed to stay at the governor's office.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In a dialogue with the students' representatives,  Governor Abilio Osorio Soares and military chief Col. Suhartono Suratman  agreed to set up a team to make a thorough investigation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Indonesia on Tuesday denied claims that its troops massacred more  than 40 East Timorese recently, and criticized Portugal for suspending  U.N.-sponsored talks over the future of the troubled territory.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Ramos-Horta is an advocate of independence for Indonesian-controlled  East Timor, and newspapers reported Taiwan had formerly barred him  to avoid antagonizing Indonesia.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner said  that so far, only 11 bodies had been identified.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Foreign  Minister Ali Alatas questioned whether Portugal truly wanted to settle  the problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, the official  Antara news agency reported.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>``The Portuguese delegation, without  checking the truth of the information, decided to temporarily suspend  the ongoing dialogue,'' Antara quoted Alatas as saying.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Alatas said the claims  of a massacre were not true.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Alatas said it was the third  time that Portugal had unilaterally suspended talks over East Timor  since 1986.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Meanwhile, about 500 students  ended their noisy but peaceful rally outside the office of East Timor's  governor in Dili Tuesday after receiving promises that the reported  killings would be investigated.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>``Unfortunately, Indonesia has increased its  deployment and the brutality of its military actions in East Timor,''  said ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>However, it could not confirm claims  that dozens of people had been killed.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Based on this, Alatas said, Indonesia was skeptical about  Portugal's sincerity, Antara reported.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Meanwhile,  an unidentified man, believed to be a rebel, was reported to have  shot and wounded Izildo Pereira, a civilian, in Baucau, 100 kilometers  (62 miles) east of Dili.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The students also demanded  a total withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers from East Timor.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on churches, mobs set fire to  four mosques in West Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands  of Christians degenerated into a riot, the military and a Muslim leader  said.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The United Nations, however,  does not recognize Indonesia's claim.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Taiwan's Foreign Ministry on Thursday blamed ``administrative negligence''  for an incident in which Nobel Peace Prize winner Josi Ramos-Horta  was left stranded at the airport for hours after being refused entry.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party alleged Ramos-Horta  had been refused entry because he planned to speak on behalf of Chen  Shui-bian's campaign to be re-elected as mayor of Taipei.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Before being suspended, the  talks centered on an Indonesian offer to give East Timor autonomy  in return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty  there.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Izildo, 30, who was shot Sunday, was being  treated at a military hospital in Dili.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>``I hope Muslims  ... are not deceived by such provocations,'' said Wahid, who has been  pushing for religious unity.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The violence in the Christian-dominated  city of Kupang was in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of  22 churches by Muslim mobs in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when  14 people were killed.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Opposition supporters alleged the incident Wednesday night was politically  motivated.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>There is also political turmoil as students protesters  demand greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former  President Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in  May.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's  largest Muslim grouping, the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, accused  provocateurs of whipping up religious strife when the sprawling Southeast  Asian nation is trying to head toward democracy.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The only countries that don't allow me in would be countries like  Iraq, Iran,'' he told reporters before catching an afternoon flight  to attend a conference in Australia.</a>
