<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It will serve as a space tugboat in the  early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and communications.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The station,  involving 16 nations with the United States and Russia playing the  biggest roles, will consist of more than 100 elements that will take  45 assembly flights to complete.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The unmanned launch, set for 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday from  Baikonur in Kazakhstan, has been delayed for one year mainly because  of the cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure to complete another  part of the station.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Russian space experts were making final preparations Thursday at the  Baikonur rocket base to launch the first component of a multibillion  dollar international space station after a year of delay.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Built by  a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket,  the 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is a U.S.-funded  component of the station.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>``After years of discussing, planning and replanning,  we are about to launch hardware,'' Gretchen McClain, deputy associate  administrator for the new station, said at a news conference earlier  this week.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It will serve as an orbital home  for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for up to 20 years.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>``We are ready to begin a project that will bring us into  the millennium with women and men living and working in space permanently.''</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The station will weigh 500 tons (more than a million pounds) and is  expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States  planning to pay dlrs 21 billion.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>I would like to knock on wood, which is rather  common in the Russian tradition,'' said Alexander Krasnov, a deputy  chief of Russian Space Agency's manned flight department.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Having lost hope of getting the promised government funds, the Russian  space agency has sold its early research time on the station to NASA  for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Zarya is  to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space  shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity  connecting module.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The Russian Khrunichev company has earned over dlrs 200 million for  building Zarya, whose design was based on earlier Soviet spacecraft,  including some of the Mir's six modules.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Russian officials added their traditional note of superstition.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The shuttle crew will attach the two modules together  in three space walks, using the Endeavors robot arm.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Koptev assailed some Russian space  engineers who continue to insist that more money should be put into  Russia's own battered 12-year old Mir space station to extend its  lifetime instead of committing more funds to the new space outpost.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about  1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems, but because of  the trust and mutual respect ... the international space station is  going to be a reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference  after the launch.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Agency chief Yuri Koptev  said that taking part in the new station is the only hope for the  beleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding has collapsed since  the Soviet collapse.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>This is to be followed by 43 more flights  by American and Russian rockets carrying more than 100 parts to be  assembled in space to form a 900,000-pound research station housing  up to seven astronauts.</a>
