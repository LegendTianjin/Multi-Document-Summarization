<s id="s0">Cabinet was told nothing about GCHQ spying programmes, says Chris Huhne</s>
<s id="s1">Cabinet ministers and members of the national security council were told nothing about the existence and scale of the vast data-gathering programmes run by British and American intelligence agencies , a former member of the government has revealed . </s>
<s id="s2">Chris Huhne , who was in the cabinet for two years until 2012 , said ministers were in "utter ignorance " of the two biggest covert operations , Prism and Tempora . </s>
<s id="s3">The former Liberal Democrat MP admitted he was shocked and mystified by the surveillance capabilities disclosed by the Guardian from files leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden . </s>
<s id="s4">" The revelations put a giant question mark into the middle of our surveillance state , " he said . </s>
<s id="s5">" The state should not feel itself entitled to know , see and memorise everything that the private citizen communicates . </s>
<s id="s6">The state is our servant . </s>
<s id="s7">" Writing in Monday 's Guardian , Huhne also questioned whether the Home Office had deliberately misled parliament about the need for the communications data bill when GCHQ , the government 's eavesdropping headquarters , already had remarkable and extensive snooping capabilities . </s>
<s id="s8">He said this lack of information and accountability showed " the supervisory arrangements for our intelligence services need as much updating as their bugging techniques " . </s>
<s id="s9">Over the past three months the Guardian has made a series of disclosures about the activities of GCHQ and its much bigger American counterpart , the National Security Agency . </s>
<s id="s10">Two of the most significant programmes uncovered in the Snowden files were Prism , run by the NSA , and Tempora , which was set up by GCHQ . </s>
<s id="s11">Between them , they allow the agencies to harvest , store and analyse data about millions of phone calls , emails and search engine queries . </s>
<s id="s12">As a cabinet minister and member of the national security council ( NSC) , Huhne said he would have expected to be told about these operations , particularly as they were relevant to proposed legislation . </s>
<s id="s13">" The cabinet was told nothing about GCHQ 's Tempora or its US counterpart , the NSA 's Prism , nor about their extraordinary capability to hoover up and store personal emails , voice contact , social networking activity and even internet searches . </s>
<s id="s14">" I was also on the national security council , attended by ministers and the heads of the Secret [ Intelligence Service , MI6 ] and Security Service [MI5] , GCHQ and the military . </s>
<s id="s15">If anyone should have been briefed on Prism and Tempora , it should have been the NSC. </s>
<s id="s16">" I do not know whether the prime minister or the foreign secretary ( who has oversight of GCHQ ) were briefed , but the NSC was not . </s>
<s id="s17">This lack of information , and therefore accountability , is a warning that the supervision of our intelligence services needs as much updating as their bugging techniques . </s>
<s id="s18">" Huhne said Prism and Tempora "put in the shade Tony Blair 's proposed ID cards , 90-day detention without trial and the abolition of jury trials " . </s>
<s id="s19">He added : " Throughout my time in parliament , the Home Office was trying to persuade politicians to invest in 'upgrading ' Britain 's capability to recover data showing who is emailing and phoning whom . </s>
<s id="s20">Yet this seems to be exactly what GCHQ was already doing . </s>
<s id="s21">Was the Home Office trying to mislead ? </s>
<s id="s22">" The Home Office was happy to allow the NSC and the cabinet – let alone parliament – to remain in utter ignorance of Prism/Tempora while deciding on the communications data bill . </s>
<s id="s23">" The draft bill would have given police and the security services access , without a warrant , to details of all online communication in the UK – such as the time , duration , originator and recipient , and the location of the device from which it was made . </s>
<s id="s24">The legislation was eventually dropped after splits in the coalition . </s>
<s id="s25">Proper scrutiny of the intelligence agencies was vital , said Huhne , and surveillance techniques needed to be tempered . </s>
<s id="s26">" Joseph Goebbels was simply wrong when he argued that 'if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear '. Information is power , and the necessary consequence is that privacy is freedom . </s>
<s id="s27">Only totalitarians pry absolutely . </s>
<s id="s28">" Huhne , formerly the energy and climate change minister , was jailed this year after he admitted perverting the course of justice over claims his ex-wife took speeding points for him . </s>
<s id="s29">In February he was sentenced to eight months in prison but was released after serving 62 days . </s>
<s id="s30">His intervention comes as concern about the oversight and scrutiny of Britain 's spy agencies grows . </s>
<s id="s31">While former members of the intelligence community insist GCHQ , MI5 and MI6 operate with integrity and within the law , even they have questioned whether the oversight regime is fit for purpose following the Snowden revelations . </s>
<s id="s32">Over the last few days a former member of parliament 's intelligence and security committee , Lord King , a former director of GCHQ , Sir David Omand , and a former director general of MI5 , Dame Stella Rimington , have questioned whether the agencies need to be more transparent and accept more rigorous scrutiny of their work . </s>
<s id="s33">On Monday , a former legal director of MI5 and MI6 will add his weight to the calls for change . </s>
<s id="s34">David Bickford told the Guardian Britain 's intelligence agencies should seek authority for secret operations from a judge rather than a minister because public unease about their surveillance techniques is at an all-time high . </s>
<s id="s35">Bickford said the government should pass responsibility to the courts because of widespread "dissatisfaction with the covert , intrusive powers of the UK intelligence and law enforcement agencies " . </s>
<s id="s36">" Whether this is based on perception or reality does n't really matter , " he said . </s>
<s id="s37">" As long as government ministers continue to authorise the agencies ' eavesdropping , telephone and electronic surveillance , and informant approval , the public will believe that there is an unhealthy seamless relationship between them . </s>
<s id="s38">" Bickford said it was time for ministers to " step out of the equation and leave the authorisation of these highly intrusive methods to the judiciary " . </s>
<s id="s39">Bickford was drafted in to MI5 and MI6 following a series of scandals , including the furore over the book Spycatcher , written by the senior former MI5 officer Peter Wright . </s>
<s id="s40">He worked for almost a decade until 1995 and still advises governments on countering international organised crime and terrorist money laundering . </s>
<s id="s41">Bickford said giving judges rather than cabinet ministers responsibility for authorising sensitive operations would "reduce the risk of perception of collusion … and limit the room for accusations of political interference . </s>
<s id="s42">" " Government may argue that all this is unnecessary as there is adequate oversight of the agencies . </s>
<s id="s43">However , that cannot substitute for independent judicial authority at the coal face . </s>
<s id="s44">" Meanwhile , on Sunday , the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers ( WAN-IFRA ) condemned the way the British government had threatened legal action against the Guardian newspaper unless it destroyed the copy of the Snowden files it had in London . </s>
<s id="s45">"WAN-IFRA calls on democratic governments to recognise that acts of intimidation and surveillance against the press risk undermining the fabric of transparent , accountable governance , " the organisation 's board said in a resolution issued during its meeting on the eve of this week 's World Publishing Expo in Berlin , Germany . </s>

<s id="s238">[SteB1] Cabinet ministers and members of the national security council were told nothing about the existence and scale of the vast data-gathering programmes run by British and American intelligence agencies , a former member of the government has revealed . </s>
<s id="s239">Chris Huhne , who was in the cabinet for two years until 2012 , said ministers were in &amp;quot ;utter ignorance&amp;quot ; of the two biggest covert operations , Prism and Tempora . </s>
<s id="s240">The former Liberal Democrat MP admitted he was shocked and mystified by the surveillance capabilities disclosed by the Guardian from files leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden . </s>
<s id="s241">This is incredibly serious , it says we live in a fake democracy . </s>
<s id="s242">This mass surveillance programme is probably the biggest change to our society ever . </s>
<s id="s243">Yet apparently it was implemented without the knowledge of some of the most senior politicians in govenrment . </s>
<s id="s244">It is incredibly sinister that some shadowy people , beyond the scrutiny of the Cabinet , can make such huge changes to our country and system . </s>
<s id="s245">However , what is really serious is why such a huge programme , and such a major change to our society was kept secret from our ministers . </s>
<s id="s246">This is clearly anti-democratic at the very least . </s>
<s id="s247">Why would they keep it 's existence secret from Ministers . </s>
<s id="s248">You see the most sinister thing about this secrecy is that they kept the whole existence of this programme secret . </s>
<s id="s249">There was no legitimate reason for keeping the existence of these programmes secret , aside from anti-democratic ones . </s>
<s id="s250">For instance we know of the existence of the NSA and GCHQ , and have a rough idea what they do . </s>
<s id="s251">However , that public knowledge is no use for circumventing them , without specific knowledge of how they work . </s>
<s id="s252">Likewise , with PRISM etc , public of its existence would not of hampered its running without more specific information . </s>
<s id="s253">In other words , whatever reason the existence of these programmes was kept secret , it was n't for normal national security reasons . </s>
<s id="s254">It was to defeat public and political scrutiny . </s>
<s id="s255">That is not a legitimate reason for keeping something secret . </s>
<s id="s256">This is a dishonest , anit-democratic , and possibly treasonable reason for keeping something secret . </s>
<s id="s257">In short there needs to be a public inquiry to establish who authorized this programme , and whether they had the political authority to make such massive secret changes to our society . </s>
<s id="s258">Of course I realise that hell would freeze over first , which is why this government is illegitimate . </s>
<s id="s259">There is no legitimate way ,that this government can evade properly explaining this to the public . </s>
<s id="s260">That they have n't undermines their legitimacy to rule , because none of the public were aware of this at the last general election . </s>
<s id="s261">People might and most certainly would have voted very differently if they had known about this . </s>
<s id="s262">Many of the public would never vote for a party that justified this . </s>
<s id="s263">It is this reason why this is anti-democratic . </s>
<s id="s264">The lunacy and incredible stupidity of this programme , is that these fuckwits have just delivered us into the hands of future dictators . </s>
<s id="s265">Even if the use of this programme is carefully monitored etc now , which I do n't believe it is , it is n't in who 's in charge of the system now that is the problem . </s>
<s id="s266">The problem is who gets control of this system in the future . </s>
<s id="s267">The idiots that run our society never seem to have stopped and thought about who might gain control of the system in the future . </s>
<s id="s268">If any shady wannabe dictator gets into government , without the public realising what their agenda is , this control of society , could make it very difficult to get rid of them , and very easy for them to declare themselves a dictator . </s>
<s id="s269">History shows that many people who became dictators , entered government through more legitimate ways . </s>
