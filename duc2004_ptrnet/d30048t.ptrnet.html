<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The biggest role in the rescue  program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund,  which said last week that it would contribute at least $15 billion  _ and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even  more.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Direct U.S. aid  to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year  of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund,  the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its own  capital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not only for Brazil but  to stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico and other countries that  are major U.S. trading partners.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared  to death by what's been happening in the markets, and what could happen  in their own districts,'' a White House official said last week, ``and  they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it.''</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It will be interesting to  know,'' the Cuban leader said at a hotel press conference shortly  after his arrival for the annual Ibero-American summit.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>But many experts cite the confluence  of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the  world: two successive interest-rate cuts in the United States, Japan's  long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion  in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand,  Indonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing  to return.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Latin American leaders flew Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit  to figure out how they can shield their economies from the global  financial crisis.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Emphasizing  the scale of the threat, Castro said President Clinton was aware that  ``if South America falls into crisis, it will be extended inevitably  also to the United States,'' which is heavily involved in investments  and loans in the region.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In Brasilia,  officials said that among the measures being considered were a tax  increase on financial transactions, to three-tenths of a percent from  two-tenths of a percent, and extending the Fiscal Stabilization Fund,  which sets aside 20 percent of all taxes collected for presidential  discretionary spending.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro,  described the turmoil in world financial markets as the most important  issue facing the world at the moment.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash  out of Latin America with devastating effects on stock markets and  currency reserves.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan  Stanley Dean Witter, said signs that the Brazilian government and  the IMF were moving closer to an aid package were reassuring, and  that he did not expect much more than reassurance until next week.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The heads of state and government from Latin America,  Spain and Portugal will explore measures to ward off the financial  turmoil that already has devastated Asia and Russia.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The declaration ``calls on the international community,  and Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary  measures to promote stability in international financial markets,  which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth,'' said  Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Brazil,  the continent's largest economy and a potential bulwark against creeping  recession, is waiting for news of a dlrs 30 billion bailout package  from the International Monetary Fund.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>They also  want reforms that allow international financial institutions to head  off crises rather than react to them with rescue packages.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A joint declaration will be  signed Sunday in this ancient port city on the Douro River in northern  Portugal.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Details of the U.S. contribution,  which is expected to total several billion dollars in direct aid or  loan guarantees, have yet to be negotiated.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>This early warning  from the administration reflects memories of how Congress erupted  with objections and hearings in 1995 when President Clinton committed  $20 billion in U.S. funds to the bailout of Mexico.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling dlrs 137  billion since the financial crisis struck Thailand 15 months ago and  then spread from Asia to Russia.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>``If banks and the government don't create some kind of emergency  credit line, the only option many of our associates will have will  be to use products to pay the bonus.''</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Latin  America's leaders favor creating some kind of regulatory system for  global financial transactions that would place controls on speculators,  like measures to slow down the internatioal flow of money.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>So far, U.S. officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid  package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for  a direct contribution to Brazil.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration,  aware of the impact that a Latin American recession would have on  the United States, has actively pushed the IMF and the World Bank  to support Brazil after it was hit by investor flight.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>But the  former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market  rallies, warned that ``serious issues remain'' and that ``it will  take some time for the world to work its way out'' of what he has  repeatedly called ``the most serious international financial disruption  of the last 50 years.''</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Caught in the middle of an economic crisis, many Brazilian factories  fear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end  bonus.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>But administration  officials said last week that their early soundings indicate that  members of Congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic  collapse in Latin America that would resound in the United States,  and thus they expect few objections.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The draft declaration said recent financial market  turmoil shows that adjustments must be made quickly ``to keep the  difficulties affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all.''</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The final declaration will be approved at  Sunday's summit in this port city in northern Portugal.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The  declaration addresses the world's seven richest nations.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary  Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's  austerity plan, which is expected to be announced after Sunday's elections  but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that  the global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The timing of an aid package  for Brazil _ originally expected within the next few days _ is complicated  by unexpected delays that have cropped up in dealing with the Brazilian  government.</a>
