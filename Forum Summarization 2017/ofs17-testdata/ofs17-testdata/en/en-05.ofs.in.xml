<s id="s1">Scott Brown speaks after getting the endorsement from former New Hampshire governors , Steve Merrill , left , and Craig Benson . . </s>
<s id="s2">Scott Brown has been touring New Hampshire since April , when he announced he would be running for the state &apos;s Senate seat . </s>
<s id="s3">Hitting the campaign trail in his trademark pick-up truck , Brown has portrayed himself as an accessible candidate , introducing himself to voters at supermarkets , car shows , lobster shacks and a Harley Davidson-themed cookout . </s>
<s id="s4">A former Republican senator from neighbouring Massachusetts , Brown plans to win the election in his adopted state one handshake at a time . </s>
<s id="s5">?Join Scott , ? </s>
<s id="s6">his website implores visitors . </s>
<s id="s7">?Get on the trail . </s>
<s id="s8">? </s>
<s id="s9">That was precisely what I did last Friday , when my unexpected arrival at Brown ?s </s>
<s id="s10">statewide tour revealed a different side to his campaign . </s>
<s id="s11">Just a few miles from a town named Freedom , no less , I was expelled from two consecutive Brown campaign events , banned from asking him questions and , when I declined to abide by those terms , questioned by an officer of the law . </s>
<s id="s12">It turned out that Brown did not want to talk about about Hobby Lobby , the recent supreme court decision critics argue will deny some women contraceptive care in their insurance plans . </s>
<s id="s13">Brown , 54 , is a former military colonel , lawyer and topless model turned Republican politician , who came to prominence when he unexpectedly won the Massachusetts Senate seat in 2009 . </s>
<s id="s14">After losing that seat three years later , Brown flirted , briefly , with running for president , before switching his allegiance to New Hampshire and , in an attempt to dispense with his reputation as a carpetbagger , taking to the road to meet voters . </s>
<s id="s15">It is unclear if the strategy is working . </s>
<s id="s16">A recent poll suggested the gap between Brown and his Democratic opponent ? </s>
<s id="s17">incumbent senator Jeanne Shaheen ? </s>
<s id="s18">has more than doubled since he announced his candidacy and began touring the state three months ago . </s>
<s id="s19">The anti-woman label : especially toxic in New Hampshire He now trails Shaheen by 12 points ? </s>
<s id="s20">and also lags behind her in the fundraising contest . </s>
<s id="s21">Further , Brown still has to win the GOP primary , which in New Hampshire is not held until September 9 . </s>
<s id="s22">Even though he is widely expected to win the Republican nomination , the primary is proving a distraction . </s>
<s id="s23">Meanwhile , the Shaheen campaign , in a repeat of the playbook that saw Brown defeated in Massachusetts by Elizabeth Warren , has been relentlessly painting Brown as anti-women . </s>
<s id="s24">It is a line of attack echoed across the US as midterm campaigns heat up , and Democrats seek to activate a key demographic constituency . </s>
<s id="s25">It is not just women whom Democrats have come to rely on , but single women in particular . </s>
<s id="s26">And , like minority voters , while unmarried women tend to lean Democratic , they ?re </s>
<s id="s27">also disinclined to vote in midterm elections . </s>
<s id="s28">Democrats have been accusing Republicans of waging a ?war on women ? </s>
<s id="s29">since 2010 , citing their opposition , for example , to enforcement of equal pay , or restrictions on access to abortions . </s>
<s id="s30">The anti-woman label is especially toxic in New Hampshire , which has an impressive record of electing women . </s>
<s id="s31">Four years ago , New Hampshire became the first state in US history to have a state legislature comprised mostly of women . </s>
<s id="s32">It currently has the first ever all-woman congressional delegation ? </s>
<s id="s33">and a female governor . </s>
<s id="s34">The Brown campaign , with some justification , believe the anti-women accusation is an unfair slur on his name . </s>
<s id="s35">Unusually for a Republican , Brown is pro-choice , mostly supports access to birth control , and recently denounced a supreme court decision that critics say allows anti-abortion activists to intimidate women when they visit clinics . </s>
<s id="s36">But Brown has an Achilles heel , left exposed by a second , more high-profile supreme court decision : the judgment in favour of the Christian , family-run business Hobby Lobby . </s>
<s id="s37">A majority of justices ruled that companies like Hobby Lobby can , on religious grounds , deny their employees insurance coverage for some types of birth control . </s>
<s id="s38">The ruling was a setback for Barack Obama ?s </s>
<s id="s39">Affordable Care Act , but was far less consequential than a piece of legislation ? the so-called Blunt Amendment ? </s>
<s id="s40">which Brown championed as a senator in 2012 . </s>
<s id="s41">Brown recently told Ellen Kolb , a pro-life blogger , that his support for the Blunt Amendment &apos;cost me the election &apos; in Massachusetts . </s>
<s id="s42">That legislation would have gone further than the supreme court ruling in allowing employers to use religious exemptions to opt out of providing coverage for a wide range of health services ? </s>
<s id="s43">even , critics say , preventive care and mammograms . </s>
<s id="s44">In the Massachusetts race , Warren used Brown &apos;s support for the controversial amendment as evidence of his hostility to women . </s>
<s id="s45">She won the election decisively , and exit polls showed Brown lost the women &apos;s vote by 18 points . </s>
<s id="s46">He recently told Ellen Kolb , a pro-life blogger , that his support for the Blunt Amendment &quot; cost me the election &quot; in Massachusetts . </s>
<s id="s47">The Hobby Lobby verdict has reignited the issue , and the Brown campaign &apos;s reaction has been stumbling . </s>
<s id="s48">It took several hours to respond to the judgment earlier this month , eventually releasing a vague , two-line statement that shed no real light on his position . </s>
<s id="s49">Asked about the issue on a local radio station days later , Brown appeared to back the Hobby Lobby ruling when he said he supported religious freedom &quot;even though that may be out of touch with social opinion &quot; . </s>
<s id="s50">But it was still unclear where he stood . </s>
<s id="s51">&quot; The court made their decision and we ?ll </s>
<s id="s52">see what happens thereafter , ? </s>
<s id="s53">he said . </s>
<s id="s54">&apos; You ?re </s>
<s id="s55">getting in the face of people that don ?t </s>
<s id="s56">care to talk to you &apos; I decided to find Brown ? </s>
<s id="s57">whose wife , Gail , is a former TV journalist ? </s>
<s id="s58">on the campaign trail , and ask him to clarify his stance . </s>
<s id="s59">That , it turned out , was easier said than done . </s>
<s id="s60">While an inquiring member of the public will be told about Brown &apos;s forthcoming campaign stops , the schedule is kept secret from anyone who , like me , self-identifies as a journalist . </s>
<s id="s61">Fortunately , I received a tip-off that Brown would be appearing later in the day at a diner 100 miles north , in the foothills of the White Mountains . </s>
<s id="s62">I found Brown at a table at a restaurant called Priscilla &apos;s , introduced myself as a Guardian reporter and enquired if I could ask him some questions . </s>
<s id="s63">Brown smiled nervously and replied : &quot; What do you want to ask me about ? </s>
<s id="s64">&quot; &quot; Hobby Lobby ? </s>
<s id="s65">That would be a start , &quot; I said . </s>
<s id="s66">?I?m all set , &quot; he replied . </s>
<s id="s67">&quot; We ?re </s>
<s id="s68">enjoying ourselves right now . </s>
<s id="s69">? </s>
<s id="s70">? </s>
<s id="s71">But you ?re standing for Senate . </s>
<s id="s72">It is routine for journalists to ask you questions and usually the candidates answer. </s>
<s id="s73">? </s>
<s id="s74">? </s>
<s id="s75">Not without notifying my office . </s>
<s id="s76">&quot; Brown stood up , walked to the back of the diner , and took shelter in the bathroom . </s>
<s id="s77">A campaign aide , Jeremy , looked bewildered . </s>
<s id="s78">He lingered beside me for a few moments , before politely excusing himself ? </s>
<s id="s79">?Nice to meet you ? </s>
<s id="s80">? </s>
<s id="s81">and joining his boss in the bathroom . </s>
<s id="s82">I decided to wait in the parking lot for Team Brown to emerge into the sunlight . </s>
<s id="s83">Four minutes later , a white SUV swung round and parked next to the steps of the diner . </s>
<s id="s84">Brown came out with a phone pressed to his ear . </s>
<s id="s85">&quot; Get in ! </s>
<s id="s86">Get in ! </s>
<s id="s87">&quot; said a campaign worker holding open the car door . </s>
<s id="s88">Another man asked me to leave . </s>
<s id="s89">?You ?re </s>
<s id="s90">getting in the face of people that don ?t </s>
<s id="s91">care to talk to you , ? </s>
<s id="s92">he said . </s>
<s id="s93">That , I explained , is what journalists must sometimes do . </s>
<s id="s94">We ?re </s>
<s id="s95">used to politicians giving us evasive answers . </s>
<s id="s96">But we don ?t </s>
<s id="s97">expect them to run away from questions ? </s>
<s id="s98">unless , that is , they ?re </s>
<s id="s99">in crisis mode . </s>
<s id="s100">The truth is the fallout from the Hobby Lobby ruling puts Brown in a tight spot . </s>
<s id="s101">Shaheen , who in 1999 , as New Hampshire governor , signed a law requiring insurance companies to offer contraception coverage , has been quick to exploit her opponent &apos;s discomfort , and last week put her name to legislation that would undo the Hobby Lobby judgment . </s>
<s id="s102">&quot; This is not just an issue about who makes those decisions , &quot; she told me . </s>
<s id="s103">&quot; It is also an economic issue , because when women are not able to get insurance coverage for contraceptives , they &apos;re paying more . </s>
<s id="s104">&quot; With Brown &apos;s primary more than six weeks away , he cannot afford to alienate pro-life Republican voters by altering his stance . </s>
<s id="s105">At the same time , he is facing pressure from the upper ranks of his own campaign to do just that . </s>
<s id="s106">Julie Brown , a senior Republican figure in the state who the candidate chose as the co-chair of his Women for Brown leadership team , believes he is wrong about religious exemptions to contraceptive coverage . </s>
<s id="s107">&quot; A woman chooses what she decides to do with her body ? </s>
<s id="s108">it is between the woman , her doctor and her God , &quot; she told me . </s>
<s id="s109">Her view was shared by ?many , many ? </s>
<s id="s110">women in the state , she said , adding that she planned to discuss the contraception issue with Brown in the coming days . </s>
<s id="s111">I asked if she thought he needed to change his policy . </s>
<s id="s112">&quot; I think he should , yes , &quot; she replied . </s>
<s id="s113">&quot; I will discuss it with him , ? </s>
<s id="s114">she added . </s>
<s id="s115">? </s>
<s id="s116">I give anybody credit who changes their mind . </s>
<s id="s117">&quot; In the Massachusetts race , Warren used Brown &apos;s support for the controversial Blunt Amendment as evidence of his hostility to women . </s>
<s id="s118">&apos;I?m not making any more news &apos; With Brown &apos;s own ambassador to women urging a U-turn on such a critical issue , I thought I should try , once again , to press the candidate on where , precisely , he currently stands . </s>
<s id="s119">His next campaign stop , I was told , would take place three hours later , on the second floor of the Hobbs Tavern and Brewery , in West Ossipee . </s>
<s id="s120">I was at the tavern , mingling with about a dozen locals , when the candidate arrived . </s>
<s id="s121">Brown walked up the stairs , spotted me in the audience , frowned , turned around and walked back downstairs . </s>
<s id="s122">Jeremy , looking even more anxious than he did at Priscilla &apos;s , took me to a corner and told me that while I could witness Brown &apos;s electioneering , under no circumstances was I permitted to ask questions . </s>
<s id="s123">I was explaining to Jeremy that Senate candidates don ?t </s>
<s id="s124">get to dictate when and where journalists ask them questions , when Brown re-emerged . </s>
<s id="s125">Gruffly , he told me I had intruded in a private event . </s>
<s id="s126">He was not going to answer my questions about Hobby Lobby . </s>
<s id="s127">&quot; I?m not making any more news , &quot; he explained . </s>
<s id="s128">&quot; You ?re </s>
<s id="s129">being unprofessional and you ?re being rude . </s>
<s id="s130">&quot; A large man with chest hair poking out of his shirt put it more bluntly . </s>
<s id="s131">? </s>
<s id="s132">You have to go , ? </s>
<s id="s133">he said . </s>
<s id="s134">? </s>
<s id="s135">We can either do this the right way , or we can do this the wrong way . </s>
<s id="s136">? </s>
<s id="s137">? </s>
<s id="s138">What is the wrong way ? </s>
<s id="s139">? </s>
<s id="s140">I asked . </s>
<s id="s141">? </s>
<s id="s142">I don ?t </s>
<s id="s143">want you to find out , &quot; he said . </s>
<s id="s144">I left the campaign event in the company of the tavern &apos;s owner . </s>
<s id="s145">He and I were talking on the porch , several minutes later , when a police car pulled up . </s>
<s id="s146">I do n&apos;t know if Officer Valley , from the Ossipee Police Department , had ever before been called to deal with an errant reporter . </s>
<s id="s147">I do know he walked up to the porch with an amused look on his face . </s>
<s id="s148">? </s>
<s id="s149">How you doing ? </s>
<s id="s150">? </s>
<s id="s151">he said , shaking everyone &apos;s hand . </s>
<s id="s152">? </s>
<s id="s153">What ?s up ? </s>
<s id="s154">? </s>
<s id="s155">None of the parties disputed the facts of the case . </s>
<s id="s156">I was the journalist . </s>
<s id="s157">My job was to ask questions . </s>
<s id="s158">The man holed up inside the tavern was Scott Brown , a would-be senator who didn?t want to answer . </s>
<s id="s159">I was eventually asked to leave . </s>
<s id="s160">I left . </s>
<s id="s161">Officer Valley mulled over the situation before delivering his summary judgment . </s>
<s id="s162">?There ?s </s>
<s id="s163">no crime , ? </s>
<s id="s164">he said . </s>
<s id="s165">? </s>

<s id="s167">? </s>
<s id="s168">Three days later , in response to continued questions about Brown ?s </s>
<s id="s169">position on Hobby Lobby , his press secretary , Elizabeth Guyton , emailed a response . </s>
<s id="s170">It was the same statement as the one the campaign released the day after the Hobby Lobby decision . </s>

<s id="s386">The practice has particularly been applied by television journalists , on news shows like The O&apos;Reilly Factor [1 ] and 60 Minutes[citation needed ] and by Geraldo Rivera and other local television reporters conducting investigations . </s>

<s id="s388">This can usually be discerned by the level of physical aggression the journalist displays and in the time allowed for an uninterrupted answer . </s>
<s id="s389">Since a press agent does n&apos;t usually ask probing questions of his client , on the record , at even press conferences or interviews , I &apos;ll have to depart from your view that I &apos;ve confused the roles of press agents and journalists , though I will concede there may be divergent majority attitudes towards ambush journalism on different sides of the pond ( just as there are differences in libel laws , which might make the British counterparts something less than the searching advocates of truth some might imagine them to be ) . </s>
