<s id="s0">Exclusive: NSA pays £100m in secret funding for GCHQ</s>
<s id="s1">The US government has paid at least £100m to the UK spy agency GCHQ over the last three years to secure access to and influence over Britain &apos;s intelligence gathering programmes . </s>
<s id="s2">The top secret payments are set out in documents which make clear that the Americans expect a return on the investment , and that GCHQ has to work hard to meet their demands . </s>
<s id="s3">&quot;GCHQ must pull its weight and be seen to pull its weight , &quot; a GCHQ strategy briefing said . </s>
<s id="s4">The funding underlines the closeness of the relationship between GCHQ and its US equivalent , the National Security Agency . </s>
<s id="s5">But it will raise fears about the hold Washington has over the UK &apos;s biggest and most important intelligence agency , and whether Britain &apos;s dependency on the NSA has become too great . </s>
<s id="s6">In one revealing document from 2010 , GCHQ acknowledged that the US had &quot;raised a number of issues with regards to meeting NSA &apos;s minimum expectations &quot; . </s>
<s id="s7">It said GCHQ &quot; still remains short of the full NSA ask&quot; . </s>
<s id="s8">Ministers have denied that GCHQ does the NSA &apos;s &quot;dirty work&quot; , but in the documents GCHQ describes Britain &apos;s surveillance laws and regulatory regime as a &quot; selling point &quot; for the Americans . </s>
<s id="s9">The papers are the latest to emerge from the cache leaked by the American whistleblower Edward Snowden , the former NSA contractor who has railed at the reach of the US and UK intelligence agencies . </s>
<s id="s10">Snowden warned about the relationship between the NSA and GCHQ , saying the organisations have been jointly responsible for developing techniques that allow the mass harvesting and analysis of internet traffic . </s>
<s id="s11">&quot; It &apos;s not just a US problem , &quot; he said . </s>
<s id="s12">&quot; They are worse than the US. &quot; As well as the payments , the documents seen by the Guardian reveal : • GCHQ is pouring money into efforts to gather personal information from mobile phones and apps , and has said it wants to be able to &quot;exploit any phone , anywhere , any time &quot; . </s>
<s id="s13">• Some GCHQ staff working on one sensitive programme expressed concern about &quot; the morality and ethics of their operational work , particularly given the level of deception involved &quot; . </s>
<s id="s14">• The amount of personal data available to GCHQ from internet and mobile traffic has increased by 7,000 % in the past five years – but 60 % of all Britain &apos;s refined intelligence still appears to come from the NSA . </s>
<s id="s15">• GCHQ blames China and Russia for the vast majority of cyber-attacks against the UK and is now working with the NSA to provide the British and US militaries with a cyberwarfare capability . </s>
<s id="s16">The details of the NSA payments , and the influence the US has over Britain , are set out in GCHQ &apos;s annual &quot;investment portfolios &quot; . </s>
<s id="s17">The papers show that the NSA gave GCHQ £22.9m in 2009 . </s>
<s id="s18">The following year the NSA &apos;s contribution increased to £39.9m , which included £4m to support GCHQ &apos;s work for Nato forces in Afghanistan , and £17.2m for the agency &apos;s Mastering the Internet project , which gathers and stores vast amounts of &quot;raw &quot; information ready for analysis . </s>
<s id="s19">The NSA also paid £15.5m towards redevelopments at GCHQ &apos;s sister site in Bude , north Cornwall , which intercepts communications from the transatlantic cables that carry internet traffic . </s>
<s id="s20">&quot; Securing external NSA funding for Bude has protected ( GCHQ &apos;s core ) budget , &quot; the paper said . </s>
<s id="s21">In 2011/12 the NSA paid another £34.7m to GCHQ . </s>
<s id="s22">The papers show the NSA pays half the costs of one of the UK &apos;s main eavesdropping capabilities in Cyprus . </s>
<s id="s23">In turn , GCHQ has to take the American view into account when deciding what to prioritise . </s>
<s id="s24">A document setting out GCHQ &apos;s spending plans for 2010/11 stated : &quot; The portfolio will spend money supplied by the NSA and UK government departments against agreed requirements . </s>
<s id="s25">&quot; Other documents say the agency must ensure there has been &quot; an appropriate level of contribution … from the NSA perspective &quot; . </s>
<s id="s26">The leaked papers reveal that the UK &apos;s biggest fear is that &quot; US perceptions of the … partnership diminish , leading to loss of access , and/or reduction in investment … to the UK&quot; . </s>
<s id="s27">When GCHQ does supply the US with valuable intelligence , the agency boasts about it . </s>
<s id="s28">In one review , GCHQ boasted that it had supplied &quot;unique contributions &quot; to the NSA during its investigation of the American citizen responsible for an attempted car bomb attack in Times Square , New York City , in 2010 . </s>
<s id="s29">No other detail is provided – but it raises the possibility that GCHQ might have been spying on an American living in the US. </s>
<s id="s30">The NSA is prohibited from doing this by US law . </s>
<s id="s31">Asked about the payments , a Cabinet Office spokesman said : &quot; In a 60-year alliance it is entirely unsurprising that there are joint projects in which resources and expertise are pooled , but the benefits flow in both directions . </s>
<s id="s32">&quot; A senior security source in Whitehall added : &quot; The fact is there is a close intelligence relationship between the UK and US and a number of other countries including Australia and Canada . </s>
<s id="s33">There &apos;s no automaticity , not everything is shared . </s>
<s id="s34">A sentient human being takes decisions . </s>
<s id="s35">&quot; Although the sums represent only a small percentage of the agencies &apos; budgets , the money has been an important source of income for GCHQ . </s>
<s id="s36">The cash came during a period of cost-cutting at the agency that led to staff numbers being slashed from 6,485 in 2009 to 6,132 last year . </s>
<s id="s37">GCHQ seems desperate to please its American benefactor and the NSA does not hold back when it fails to get what it wants . </s>
<s id="s38">On one project , GCHQ feared if it failed to deliver it would &quot;diminish NSA &apos;s confidence in GCHQ &apos;s ability to meet minimum NSA requirements &quot; . </s>
<s id="s39">Another document warned : &quot; The NSA ask is not static and retaining &apos;equability &apos; will remain a challenge for the near future . </s>
<s id="s40">&quot; In November 2011 , a senior GCHQ manager working in Cyprus bemoaned the lack of staff devoted to one eavesdropping programme , saying : &quot; This is not sustainable if numbers reduce further and reflects badly on our commitments to the NSA . </s>
<s id="s41">&quot; The overriding necessity to keep on the right side of the US was revealed in a UK government paper that set out the views of GCHQ in the wake of the 2010 strategic defence and security review . </s>
<s id="s42">The document was called : &quot;GCHQ &apos;s international alliances and partnerships : helping to maintain Britain &apos;s standing and influence in the world . </s>
<s id="s43">&quot; It said : &quot; Our key partnership is with the US. </s>
<s id="s44">We need to keep this relationship healthy . </s>
<s id="s45">The relationship remains strong but is not sentimental . </s>
<s id="s46">GCHQ must pull its weight and be seen to pull its weight . </s>
<s id="s47">&quot; Astonishingly , the document admitted that 60 % of the UK &apos;s high-value intelligence &quot;is based on either NSA end-product or derived from NSA collection &quot; . </s>
<s id="s48">End product means official reports that are distillations of the best raw intelligence . </s>
<s id="s49">Another pitch to keep the US happy involves reminding Washington that the UK is less regulated than the US. </s>
<s id="s50">The British agency described this as one of its key &quot; selling points &quot; . </s>
<s id="s51">This was made explicit two years ago when GCHQ set out its priorities for the coming years . </s>
<s id="s52">&quot; We both accept and accommodate NSA &apos;s different way of working , &quot; the document said . </s>
<s id="s53">&quot; We are less constrained by NSA &apos;s concerns about compliance . </s>
<s id="s54">&quot; GCHQ said that by 2013 it hoped to have &quot;exploited to the full our unique selling points of geography , partnerships [and ] the UK &apos;s legal regime&quot; . </s>
<s id="s55">However , there are indications from within GCHQ that senior staff are not at ease with the rate and pace of change . </s>
<s id="s56">The head of one of its programmes warned the agency was now receiving so much new intelligence that its &quot;mission management … is no longer fit for purpose &quot; . </s>
<s id="s57">In June , the government announced that the &quot; single intelligence account &quot; fund that pays for GCHQ , MI5 and MI6 would be increased by 3.4 % in 2015/16 . </s>
<s id="s58">This comes after three years in which the SIA has been cut from £1.92bn to £1.88bn . </s>
<s id="s59">The agencies have also been told to make £220m savings on existing programmes . </s>
<s id="s60">The parliamentary intelligence and security committee ( ISC ) has questioned whether the agencies were making the claimed savings and said their budgets should be more rigorously scrutinised to ensure efficiencies were &quot;independently verifiable and/or sustainable &quot; . </s>
<s id="s61">The Snowden documents show GCHQ has become increasingly reliant on money from &quot;external &quot; sources . </s>
<s id="s62">In 2006 it received the vast majority of its funding directly from Whitehall , with only £14m from &quot;external &quot; funding . </s>
<s id="s63">In 2010 that rose to £118m and by 2011/12 it had reached £151m . </s>
<s id="s64">Most of this comes from the Home Office . &amp;nbsp; </s>
