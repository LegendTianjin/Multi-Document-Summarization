<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Hun Sen said  on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country  was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.''</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election  complaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the  national assembly moving and a new government formed.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Hun Sen's  Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in  July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form  a government on its own.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Opposition leaders Prince Norodom  Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition  figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not  negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence  in Beijing.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that  Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread  fraud.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Hun Sen used  Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil  war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with  his party.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Government and opposition parties have asked  King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election  negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party  to form a new government failed.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Hun  Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national  election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government  on its own.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest  opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life,  Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating  inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence  in Beijing.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability  prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised  speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands  for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize''  the political crisis.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>``I would like to make  it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted  in the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet  meeting on Friday.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Hun Sen was not home at the time of the  attack, which was followed by a police crackdown on demonstrators  contesting Hun Sen's election victory.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Both Ranariddh and  Sam Rainsy have been outside the country since parliament was ceremonially  opened on Sep. 24.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's  top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress  in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance  minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with  Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly  investigated.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Cambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader  in the U.S. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's  human rights record.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Sam Rainsy and a number of opposition figures have  been under court investigation for a grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom  Penh residence on Sep. 7.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding  resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives  calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian  law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution  include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince  Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against  anti-government demonstrations.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Hun Sen's ruling  party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition  _ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen  the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The killings of nearly 100 of  Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in  the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications  meant to distort the political situation.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three  parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such  a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an  Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the  senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>``If those results are strictly respected, there seems no  reason to hold another summit,'' Hun Sen said in a speech on the anniversary  of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The Sam Rainsy Party, in a  statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to  make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Hun Sen, however, rejected that.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>``But the ruling  party refuses to negotiate unless it is able to threaten its negotiating  partners with arrest or worse.''</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>At least four demonstrators were killed by police,  but the discovery of more than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted  speculation that the death tally could be much higher.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises  to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to  take responsibility before the nation and the people.''</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Cambodian leader  Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on  the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location.</a>
