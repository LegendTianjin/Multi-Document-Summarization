<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Two opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to censure  the government.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Yilmaz has said that an intelligence report revealing  Yigit's ties with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit,  who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had  encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans  from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the highest bid.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Yigit bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs  600 million.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday faced  intense pressure to step down after allegations that he interfered  in a privatization contract and helped a businessman linked to a mobster  secure loans.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an  indication of the government's chances of survival, which are said  to be extremely slim.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The government suspended the privatization last month  after a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation supposedly  between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party  whose backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said  he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's involvement  in the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless to go ahead  with the bidding.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Yigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy mass-circulation  national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure the paper's backing  to his center-right Motherland party in elections next year.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Milliyet's  sale to Yigit was canceled after the scandal.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Parliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence  motion that could bring down the government over an organized crime  scandal.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>During  his tenure as deputy prime minister in a 17-month government that  was toppled last week over a corruption scandal, he gave his backing  to the liberal policies of the center-right-led coalition.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left  Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority he needs in  parliament, votes against him.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>It was  not clear who made the tape, which got into the hands of an opposition  deputy.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>On that earlier tape, Cakici  was heard assuring Yigit that he will fend off rival bidders.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Ecevit,  who was prime minister three times since 1974, has over the years  shed some of the socialist idealism he was known for in the 70s.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against  Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the  privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>If approved, the legislature will debate the  motions on Monday and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Though never a Marxist, Ecevit  was in his early years viewed with suspicion by big business for espousing  socialism based on heavy government social benefits and a strong role  for the state sector in the economy.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>``Ousting the government from power will open the way for  the struggle against gangs,'' said Lutfu Esengun, a deputy from the  Islamic Virtue Party, which presented one of the three no-confidence  motions to Parliament.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>``This is a plot  and it can't be a reason for a resignation,'' Yilmaz said, adding  that he intended to continue the ``struggle against organized crime.''</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Throughout the years, Ecevit, 73, has  remained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots ``As  long as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and subordination  of Turkish Cypriots at the hands of Greek Cypriots,'' he said in July  1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of the invasion.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Bulent Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government Wednesday, is  a former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of  Cyprus in 1974 that made him an overnight hero at home.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>But the premier vowed Wednesday to  stay on, saying he was the victim of a conspiracy.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government  Wednesday, desperately needs the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier  Tansu Ciller's center-right party.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The invasion,  after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece, has led  to the division of the island.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Last month  State Minister Eyup Asik resigned after allegations he had been in  close contact with Cakici.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The political turmoil  sent the Istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely  trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran  politician abandoned efforts Monday to persuade bickering political  leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Refusing any  alliance with the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party  in Parliament, Ecevit was unable to create a political alliance strong  enough to survive a confidence vote in the deeply divided legislature.</a>
