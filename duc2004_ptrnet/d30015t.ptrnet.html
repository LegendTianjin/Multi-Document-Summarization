<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put  the nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise  by moving some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed to  live up to its earlier threat in June to strike Serbia, Milosevic  took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery  and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose  bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of  large swaths of Kosovo territory, including key roads.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on President  Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless  he takes decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the  southern Serbian province.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>``The situation therefore  remains fully as serious today as it was a week or two ago,'' he told  reporters before flying to Belgrade.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have  routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began  in late February.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>NATO's decision may depend  on a report U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to present  to the Security Council Monday on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N.  demands.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes  could occur ``if decisive measures are not immediately taken for a  radical improvement of the situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman  Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special  envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters Monday that the situation in  Kosovo is as bad now as two weeks ago.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said  Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks  ago.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A Western  diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including  tanks, have been pulled out.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Holbrooke said he will explain the ``extreme gravity of the situation''  when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana  and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke said  ``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily,  the capacity for its resumption is there.''</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>He plans to meet with the Kosovan  Albanian leaders on Tuesday.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>``While the level of fighting (in Kosovo)  may have abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there,''  Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier  Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov  and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic  and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>``We hope to make clear to president  Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the  situation,'' he said.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>``The  situation therefore remains fully as serious today as it was a week  or two ago,'' he said.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic  and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation.''</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>A Yugoslav  statement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo dispute solved  peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall defend our country  with all means.''</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them  Albanian civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said both Milosevic's  government and ethnic Albanian rebels have committed atrocities since  the conflict began, but the government abuses were on a much greater  scale.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The government said Friday that the fighting had  ended and blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels, who  are fighting for independence for the Serbian province.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>However, Ivanov  and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive measures  are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation,''  Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news  agency.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>In essence, diplomats said they believed  that the plan Holbrooke will present to Milosevic calls for a three-year  interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy  arrangement.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Russia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched  its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission  to see the Yugoslav president Sunday in Belgrade.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians  of having ``given up on independence'' and having become ``the servants  of the enemy,'' by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>A British reporter who walked across fields into the village on  Sunday said about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the Serbian police  or the Yugoslav army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Serbs reported two attacks Sunday on civilian cars by Albanian ``terrorists''  25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital.</a>

<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>``We  hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia  the extreme gravity of the situation,'' Holbrooke said after a meeting  with NATO leaders.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>To avoid such an  attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security  forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis,  ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace talks,  he said.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>U.S. officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy  who dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia,  to meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for Kosovo.</a>
