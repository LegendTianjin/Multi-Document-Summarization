<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The 67-year-old Yeltsin's health has long been a concern,  and the worry has been amplified by the secrecy surrounding his condition.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Yeltsin suffered from heart disease during the 1996 presidential election  and had a heart attack, followed by multiple bypass surgery, in the  months after his victory.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>President Boris Yeltsin's doctors have pronounced his health ``more  or less normal,'' his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(Yeltsin) was affected by a difficult  flight and the end of a difficult week,'' Yeltsin's chief spokesman,  Dmitry Yakushkin, told a news conference.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>During  his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin is expected  to discuss improving Russia's relations with the two former Soviet  republics, whose economies have suffered residual effects of the crisis  that hit Russia after it devalued its currency in August and defaulted  on some of its debt.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>But after a  series of health problems in recent years, including heart bypass  surgery in 1996, every new ailment unleashes a flurry of speculation  about the president's ability to function.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Mrs. Yeltsin expressed understanding for  Russians who took part Wednesday in protests for unpaid wages.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Asked about small bandages that were  visible on Yeltsin's hand during an awards ceremony, the press office  said the president had sustained small burns.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Mrs. Yeltsin told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she hesitated  even to touch on her husband's health ``when there is so much conjecture  on this topic.''</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>President Boris Yeltsin, on his first trip out of Russia since this  spring, canceled a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday because  he wasn't feeling well, his spokesman said.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness  would sideline him for any length of time, and aides said the president  would maintain his schedule for the rest of the week.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>She  also said that criticism of the president was normal, though it was  offensive when it focused on anything other than his professional  performance, such as his age.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand,  his press office said Thursday.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>``But surely you can't curse  a person for not being a magician.''</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Yeltsin appeared stiff  and stumbled during another public ceremony after he arrived in Tashkent,  the capital of this Central Asian nation, and had to be supported  by Uzbek President Islam Karimov.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Mrs. Yeltsin refuted rumors that  her family would leave Russia after Yeltsin leaves office in 2000  as ``absolute nonsense.''</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The health of the president, who is also commander-in-chief of the  Russian military, ``is a direct threat to the country's national security  and a factor of serious concern regarding Russia's nuclear weapons,''  he said.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>``However,  knowing the president's character, he is certain to start working  with documents and making phone calls to Russian politicians as well  as foreign leaders in view of the current situation in Kosovo.''</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>``Yeltsin's  obvious inability to perform his functions is damaging Russian state  authority, as power is being misused by the clique close to the president,''  said Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of parliament's security committee.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The 67-year-old  president, whose health has often sidelined him during his seven years  in power, has spent most of the last two months out of the limelight  and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country home outside  Moscow.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted  doubts about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis,  in which Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Yeltsin was  suffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3  Fahrenheit) and was being treated with antibiotics, the president's  doctors told the Interfax news agency.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The president insists he  has no major health problems and will serve out the remaining two  years of his term.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>On Sunday, Yeltsin had been scheduled to lay  wreaths at a monument to Alisher Naboi, an 16th century Uzbek poet,  and salute an Uzbek honor guard, but both ceremonies were canceled.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The trip is Yeltsin's first high-profile foray  since an economic crisis swamped his country in August.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Yeltsin was to fly back to  Moscow late Monday, rather than on Tuesday as scheduled, but was going  ahead with talks, including a meeting with Kazak President Nursultan  Nazarbayev.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central  Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return  home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Yeltsin's aides said the president was taking antibiotics  to ward off a bout of bronchitis and a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius  (99.3 Fahrenheit).</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>It was sunny and about 14 degrees C (57  degrees F) in Tashkent on Sunday.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on  Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about  his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained  economic crisis.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>He planned to move up all his scheduled meetings before  returning home, aides said.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>It did not say what  had caused them.</a>
