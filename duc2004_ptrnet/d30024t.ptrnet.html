<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A struggle for control of the House is under way, with Rep. Robert  Livingston conducting a telephone campaign that could lead to him  running against Newt Gingrich as speaker.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While many support him as  a veteran who understands the House and has shown shrewd political  skills in managing the massive federal budget, others are reviving  images of the Louisianan as a hot-head who gave the party a bad name  during the government shutdown two years ago and who tends toward  arm-flailing in heated moments.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: ``I personally  have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker  in January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the  same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six to deadlock  the vote.''</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A week after the White House and congressional Democrats disavowed  his ``war'' on Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's  former campaign strategist and chief outside defender, put forth a  new battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>How can you take the Congress back if you don't make a case against  the people who are running it?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Not only that, but  Carville went beyond his customary denunciations of Gingrich and the  Republicans and, in an interview, trained his fire on leaders in his  own party for not being sufficiently aggressive four weeks before  Election Day.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>``And I don't think anyone's emerging to try to pull  it together.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The concern among House Democrats, one expressed by some White House  officials as well, was that Carville's vitriol would make the Democrats  appear overly partisan and could be especially damaging to Democrats  in marginal districts who do not want to appear too easy on the president.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>``My sense of frustration is that I believe the Democrats  have a much better chance of doing much better than anyone expects,''  Carville said.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Everybody ought to be pushing, the leadership in the  Congress, the White House, the DNC.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Sounding increasingly agitated, he went on: ``The only people  left to be activated in this election are Democrats.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>With attention now shifting to the  House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry  Hyde told fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday  that the only witness Republicans were likely to call would be the  independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>High-profile right-wingers lost across the  country, from Attorney General Dan Lungren in the California governor's  race to Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election in North Carolina,  to Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, who failed in a Senate race despite  a huge spending advantage over Sen. Russell Feingold, to Ellen Sauerbrey  in Maryland, who proved unable on her second try to prevail over an  unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>He worked furiously and successfully in the  last ten days before the balloting to persuade Democratic loyalists  not to stay home and sulk, appearing on behalf of no fewer than 224  candidates, according to his office.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections,  when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Hyde, the chairman, told lawmakers  he hoped to have the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment  by Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands  and put it into Gingrich's.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>``Everyone is asking the same question:  Can we refocus the message and re-energize our base without re-aligning  the leadership?''</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>But California voters also complicated the nominating process and  set Gore strategists to work on tactics to uncomplicate it, because  he and they consider the state absolutely central to his presidential  aspirations.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The officials said that  Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the election returns but  also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure  with the speaker over the budget process.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Close to two-thirds of voters nationwide  told exit pollsters that they intended to send no message about Clinton,  but they made it clear in response to other questions that they disliked  the House inquiry into the president's alleged misdeeds and wanted  to see it end.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The budget, he said, ``has been a vehicle for conservatives  over the years to add restrictions on federal money for abortion and  other things you can't get through the Senate or past a presidential  veto.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Taking his share of the blame for  his party's losses, the Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how  the public would recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplified in the  modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican  themes.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The list of possible candidates for leadership  positions included Rep.e Steve Largent of Oklahoma, who talked with  Livingston on Thursday about challenging Gingrich, Republican officials  said, speaking on the condition that their names not be reported.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>In another move, Gingrich has indicated that he is willing to cede  control over the party's congressional campaign committee, allowing  the whole House to select its members.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Even if Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could  be denied re-election as speaker in January if Salmon and at least  five others refuse to vote for him.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>The returns  _ an even break in the Senate and a Democratic gain of five in the  House of Representatives _ also made the impeachment of President  Clinton less likely.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Rep.  Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, complained to Erskine Bowles,  the White House chief of staff, after Carville appeared on the NBC  News program ``Meet the Press'' on Sept. 27 and declared, ``Cpl.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>He is studying the possibility of a presidential  race, but before he or any other Republican nominee can hope to win,  he said in an interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans and their  leaders need to learn some lessons.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Carville  said he told officials at the White House, ``Don't waste your breath  about calling me and telling me not to say this.''</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>We ought to hammer Gingrich every  day.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>``If  you make it a referendum on a president with a 67 per cent approval  rating, as they tried to do, you shouldn't be surprised if the election  goes against you,'' said Gov.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>But many were already  angry at him for what they said was his failure to articulate a clear  message for the party going into the elections and for a messy budget  process that gave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted  Republican principles of fiscal conservativism by containing massive  amounts of spending for local projects.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>Several Republicans said  that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee  and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker,  and Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for  votes.</a>
