<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Castro, Latin America's only  remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case  against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of  Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while  Frei is attending the summit.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's  arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic  passport and had immunity from arrest.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>British police arrested Pinochet in  his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request  from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of  murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Castro  joked that he would have thought police could have waited another  24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit  being held here.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Chilean President Eduardo Frei criticized the arrest,  saying the Spanish magistrate's arrest order was tantamount to not  recognizing Chile's institutions.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it was  accused of providing military intelligence to the British.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>His arrest this time appeared to reflect a tougher attitude toward  right-wing dictators by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government,  which replaced a Conservative Party administration 18 months ago and  promised an ``ethical'' foreign policy.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Castro  had just finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city  hotel.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The former strongman's son vowed to  hire top attorneys to defend his 82-year-old father, who ruled Chile  with an iron fist for 17 years.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one  lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator  has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The rallies were mostly  peaceful, although riot police used tear gas and water cannons on  some pro-Pinochet protesters trying to break through police lines  into the British embassy on Sunday evening.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Chilean officials, meanwhile,  issued strong protests and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to  argue for Pinochet's release.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest  in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it  a case of ``international meddling.''</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Pinochet left government in 1990,  but remained as army chief until March when he became a senator-for-life.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>``The (Pinochet) case is serious ... the  problem is delicate'' and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament  and armed forces bear watching, Castro said.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British  police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>He expressed surprise  that the British had arrested Pinochet, especially since he had provided  support to England during its 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland  Islands.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday calling the arrest ``an  insult'' and thanking the Chilean government, rightist politicians  and the military for their support.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Castro compared the action with the  establishment in Rome in August of an International Criminal Court,  a move Cuba has expressed reservations about.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>``It seems to me that what has  happened there (in London) is universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters  covering the Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The judge is  probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his  rule in the 1970s and 80s.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The United States was one of only seven countries that voted  against creating the court.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Castro said the court  ought to be independent of the U.N. Security Council, because ``we  already know who commands there,'' an apparent reference to the United  States.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>He said the case seemed to be ``unprecedented and unusual.''</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Pinochet,  who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations  of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks with Lady Thatcher and  her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district  four days before he was hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct.  9.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>``The idea that  such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be claiming diplomatic immunity  I think for most people in this country would be pretty gut-wrenching  stuff,'' Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting  Corp. television interview Sunday.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Pinochet had  gone to the hospital to have a back operation Oct. 9.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Any legal defense would be up  to Pinochet's family.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>``Spain also lived under an authoritarian  for 40 years and many of its present institutions are inherited from  that regime,'' Frei said in Porto, Portugal, where he was attending  the Ibero-American Summit.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized  for perhaps two more weeks faces a long battle through British courts  to avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judges who instigated  the proceedings, and an appearance at London's Bow Street magistrate's  court.</a>
