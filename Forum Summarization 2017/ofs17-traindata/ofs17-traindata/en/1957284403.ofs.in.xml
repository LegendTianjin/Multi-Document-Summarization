<s id="s0">BT and Vodafone among telecoms companies passing details to GCHQ</s>
<s id="s1">Some of the world &apos;s leading telecoms firms , including BT and Vodafone , are secretly collaborating with Britain &apos;s spy agency GCHQ , and are passing on details of their customers &apos; phone calls , email messages and Facebook entries , documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden show . </s>
<s id="s2">BT , Vodafone Cable , and the American firm Verizon Business – together with four other smaller providers – have given GCHQ secret unlimited access to their network of undersea cables . </s>
<s id="s3">The cables carry much of the world &apos;s phone calls and internet traffic . </s>
<s id="s4">In June the Guardian revealed details of GCHQ &apos;s ambitious data-hoovering programmes , Mastering the Internet and Global Telecoms Exploitation , aimed at scooping up as much online and telephone traffic as possible . </s>
<s id="s5">It emerged GCHQ was able to tap into fibre-optic cables and store huge volumes of data for up to 30 days . </s>
<s id="s6">That operation , codenamed Tempora , has been running for 20 months . </s>
<s id="s7">On Friday Germany &apos;s Süddeutsche newspaper published the most highly sensitive aspect of this operation – the names of the commercial companies working secretly with GCHQ , and giving the agency access to their customers &apos; private communications . </s>
<s id="s8">The paper said it had seen a copy of an internal GCHQ powerpoint presentation from 2009 discussing Tempora . </s>
<s id="s9">The document identified for the first time which telecoms companies are working with GCHQ &apos;s &quot; special source &quot; team . </s>
<s id="s10">It gives top secret codenames for each firm , with BT ( &quot; Remedy &quot; ) , Verizon Business ( &quot; Dacron &quot; ) , and Vodafone Cable ( &quot; Gerontic&quot; ) . </s>
<s id="s11">The other firms include Global Crossing ( &quot; Pinnage &quot; ) , Level 3 ( &quot; Little &quot; ) , Viatel ( &quot;Vitreous &quot; ) and Interoute ( &quot; Streetcar &quot; ) . </s>
<s id="s12">The companies refused to comment on any specifics relating to Tempora , but several noted they were obliged to comply with UK and EU law . </s>
<s id="s13">The revelations are likely to dismay GCHQ and Downing Street , who are fearful that BT and the other firms will suffer a backlash from customers furious that their private data and intimate emails have been secretly passed to a government spy agency . </s>
<s id="s14">In June a source with knowledge of intelligence said the companies had no choice but to co-operate in this operation . </s>
<s id="s15">They are forbidden from revealing the existence of warrants compelling them to allow GCHQ access to the cables . </s>
<s id="s16">Together , these seven companies operate a huge share of the high-capacity undersea fibre-optic cables that make up the backbone of the internet &apos;s architecture . </s>
<s id="s17">GCHQ &apos;s mass tapping operation has been built up over the past five years by attaching intercept probes to the transatlantic cables where they land on British shores . </s>
<s id="s18">GCHQ &apos;s station in Bude , north Cornwall , plays a role . </s>
<s id="s19">The cables carry data to western Europe from telephone exchanges and internet servers in north America . </s>
<s id="s20">This allows GCHQ and NSA analysts to search vast amounts of data on the activity of millions of internet users . </s>
<s id="s21">Metadata – the sites users visit , whom they email , and similar information – is stored for up to 30 days , while the content of communications is typically stored for three days . </s>
<s id="s22">GCHQ has the ability to tap cables carrying both internet data and phone calls . </s>
<s id="s23">By last year GCHQ was handling 600m &quot;telephone events &quot; each day , had tapped more than 200 fibre-optic cables and was able to process data from at least 46 of them at a time . </s>
<s id="s24">Each of the cables carries data at a rate of 10 gigabits per second , so the tapped cables had the capacity , in theory , to deliver more than 21 petabytes a day – equivalent to sending all the information in all the books in the British Library 192 times every 24 hours . </s>
<s id="s25">This operation is carried out under clandestine agreements with the seven companies , described in one document as &quot;intercept partners &quot; . </s>
<s id="s26">The companies are paid for logistical and technical assistance . </s>
<s id="s27">The identity of the companies allowing GCHQ to tap their cables was regarded as extremely sensitive within the agency . </s>
<s id="s28">Though the Tempora programme itself was classified as top secret , the identities of the cable companies was even more secret , referred to as &quot;exceptionally controlled information &quot; , with the company names replaced with the codewords , such as &quot; GERONTIC&quot; , &quot; REMEDY&quot; and &quot; PINNAGE&quot; . </s>
<s id="s29">However , some documents made it clear which codenames referred to which companies . </s>
<s id="s30">GCHQ also assigned the firms &quot; sensitive relationship teams &quot; . </s>
<s id="s31">One document warns that if the names emerged it could cause &quot;high-level political fallout &quot; . </s>
<s id="s32">Germans have been enraged by the revelations of spying by the National Security Agency and GCHQ after it emerged that both agencies were hoovering up German data as well . </s>
<s id="s33">On Friday the Süddeutsche said it was now clear that private telecoms firms were far more deeply complicit in US-UK spying activities than had been previously thought . </s>
<s id="s34">The source familiar with intelligence maintained in June that GCHQ was &quot; not looking at every piece of straw &quot; but was sifting a &quot;vast haystack of data &quot; for what he called &quot;needles &quot; . </s>
<s id="s35">He added : &quot; If you had the impression we are reading millions of emails , we are not . </s>
<s id="s36">There is no intention in this whole programme to use it for looking at UK domestic traffic – British people talking to each other . </s>
<s id="s37">&quot; The source said analysts used four criteria for determining what was examined : security , terror , organised crime and Britain &apos;s economic wellbeing .&quot; </s>
<s id="s38">The vast majority of the data is discarded without being looked at … we simply do n&apos;t have the resources . </s>
<s id="s39">&quot; Nonetheless , the agency repeatedly referred to plans to expand this collection ability still further in the future . </s>
<s id="s40">Once it is collected , analysts are able to search the information for emails , online chats and browsing histories using an interface called XKeyscore , uncovered in the Guardian on Wednesday . </s>
<s id="s41">By May 2012 , 300 analysts from GCHQ and 250 NSA analysts had direct access to search and sift through the data collected under the Tempora program . </s>
<s id="s42">Documents seen by the Guardian suggest some telecoms companies allowed GCHQ to access cables which they did not themselves own or operate , but only operated a landing station for . </s>
<s id="s43">Such practices could raise alarm among other cable providers who do not co-operate with GCHQ programmes that their facilities are being used by the intelligence agency . </s>
<s id="s44">Telecoms providers can be compelled to co-operate with requests from the government , relayed through ministers , under the 1984 Telecommunications Act , but privacy advocates have raised concerns that the firms are not doing enough to challenge orders enabling large-scale surveillance , or are co-operating to a degree beyond that required by law . </s>
<s id="s45">&quot; We urgently need clarity on how close the relationship is between companies assisting with intelligence gathering and government , &quot; said Eric King , head of research for Privacy International . </s>
<s id="s46">&quot; Were the companies strong-armed , or are they voluntary intercept partners ? </s>
<s id="s47">&quot; Vodafone said it complied with the laws of all the countries in which its cables operate . </s>
<s id="s48">&quot; Media reports on these matters have demonstrated a misunderstanding of the basic facts of European , German and UK legislation and of the legal obligations set out within every telecommunications operator &apos;s licence … Vodafone complies with the law in all of our countries of operation , &quot; said a spokesman . </s>
<s id="s49">&quot; Vodafone does not disclose any customer data in any jurisdiction unless legally required to do so . </s>
<s id="s50">Questions related to national security are a matter for governments not telecommunications operators . </s>
<s id="s51">&quot; A spokeswoman for Interoute said : &quot; As with all communication providers in Europe we are required to comply with European and local laws including those on data protection and retention . </s>
<s id="s52">From time to time we are presented with requests from authorities . </s>
<s id="s53">When we receive such requests , they are processed by our legal and security teams and if valid , acted upon . </s>
<s id="s54">&quot; A spokeswoman for Verizon said : &quot; Verizon continually takes steps to safeguard our customers &apos; privacy . </s>
<s id="s55">Verizon also complies with the law in every country in which we operate . </s>
<s id="s56">&quot; BT declined to comment . </s>
