<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance  are open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters in  the West Bank town of Ramallah.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Clinton administration officials  said the White House had not yet decided whether Clinton would fly  to the newly opened Gaza International Airport aboard Air Force One,  given the symbolism of the president's jet landing on Palestinian  soil with the trappings of a state visit.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since the signing of a land-for-security  accord, Jewish settlers have accelerated the establishment of makeshift  communities on West Bank hilltops, in an explicit bid to keep the  land from being turned over to the Palestinians.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Less than a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton is to arrive for  a visit meant to bolster a new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the  two sides exchanged angry accusations Sunday over Jewish settlements  and street clashes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday in a confrontation  outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the northern West Bank.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament,  warned of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements  in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish  a state.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Meanwhile, at a meeting  of the Israeli Cabinet, ministers expressed dismay over an outbreak  of street clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops  in the West Bank.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Israel says Yasser Arafat's  Palestinian Authority is orchestrating the street fighting.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Palestinians claim it is Israel that has violated  the summit agreement reached in October by not freeing jailed political  activists, by confiscating West Bank land for roads and allowing Jewish  settlers to seize hilltops for expansion.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli  soldiers were injured in similar clashes throughout the West Bank.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>``The Palestinians have been asked to immediately  stop the violence and incitement to violence,'' the Cabinet said in  a statement.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>And three days before that, Israelis were horrified by television  footage of an Israeli soldier being dragged from a car and beaten  with chunks of concrete by a Palestinian mob.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>At  the gathering, the PNC and other Palestinians in attendance are to  reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national charter that  call for Israel's destruction.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The past week's protests grew out of an increasingly bitter  dispute over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing over the  scheduled meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian  parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Israel has demanded that the Palestinians  hold an actual vote at the meeting rather than simply proclaiming  the charter changed, but the Palestinians on Sunday repeated their  objections to that.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>In Israel, increasing  concern is being voiced over Clinton's planned visit to Gaza, the  first ever by a sitting U.S. president.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing  excuse after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces  a very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down  the government in the event of another troop withdrawal.</a>
