<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Doubts  over Thailand's ability to stage the games increased over the past  year-and-a-half after the country entered its worst economic downturn  in decades.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The decision to award the contract for  the sports complex was controversial, with critics calling it an attempt  to bail out the property developer's failed housing estate.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company  that owns the housing estate, threatened to prevent the company from  finishing the complex in time for the Dec. 6-20 games.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Santiparb told the Post the money problems  had been overcome by shifting 200 million baht (dlrs 5 million) worth  of credit guarantees from a project that had been scrapped to cover  the construction cost of the complex.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Deputy Prime  Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who chairs the organizing committee, expressed  doubt last month that the complex would be completed on time because  of the financial problems.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thai police have detained more than 300 beggars, most from neighboring  countries, in a campaign to make Bangkok's streets safer for spectators  and athletes arriving for the upcoming Asian Games, a senior police  officer said Friday.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thailand won  host rights for the quadrennial games in 1995, but setbacks in preparations  led officials of the Olympic Council of Asia late last year to threaten  to move the games to another country.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Santiparb Tejavanija,  deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee,  said construction of the sports complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing  estate is 95 percent complete and will be finished this month, the  Bangkok Post reported.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Preparations for the games have  been plagued by political interference by previous governments, alleged  corruption and incompetence.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Organizers of December's Asian Games have dismissed press reports  that a sports complex would not be completed on time, saying preparations  are well in hand, a local newspaper said Friday.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The body governing the games threatened several times  to award Asia's version of the Olympics to other countries, but Thailand  argued that all would be ready by opening day.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>But suspicion immediately arose that the real reason was the  continued strain in relations since a Thai janitor stole precious  jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989 and fled home.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>``I can hereby  confirm that regardless of what Thailand has faced, we ... have tried  to accommodate all requests for the 13th Asian Games,'' said Bhichai.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In a welcoming speech, Thai  Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, also chairman of the Thai  organizing committee, told delegation members to cast aside any doubts  over whether the Dec. 6-20 games will be a success.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The Bangkok games are  expected to attract more than 10,000 athletes from 43 nations.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Thailand showed its nearly complete facilities for the Asian Games  to a tough jury Thursday _ the heads of the organizing committees  from the 43 nations competing in the December event.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Thai  police recovered the jewels and returned them, but many were fakes  _ leading the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officers and members  of Thailand's power elite kept the loot.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>In a letter to the Thai  prime minister's office, reported Thursday by Bangkok newspapers,  Saudi sports authorities cited the looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan  and national centenary celebrations as reasons for suddenly pulling  out.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Since the Thai organizers began their preparations, they have faced  many difficulties, most of them resulting from the country's financial  crisis, he said.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Games left organizers  scrambling Thursday to change schedules and Thai diplomats mulling  a decade of relations strained by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>``We have a strong of sense of relief,'' said  Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Kuwait-based Olympic  Council of Asia and a frequent critic of Thailand's organizing committee.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The Olympic Council of Asia, meanwhile, is working with the  Bangkok Organizing Committee to come up with a contingency plan in  case of any possible emergency, said its director general, Muttaleb.</a>

<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Construction workers  are trying to ensure that the road leading to the stadium, including  a flyover at a key intersection, will be completed on time for the  games.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Englishman Bob Houghton, who coaches the national team,  said recalling Fan and Sun for the Asian Games would allow him to  ``see if they can bring the things they have learned recently in England  to the national team,'' the China Sports Daily said.</a>
