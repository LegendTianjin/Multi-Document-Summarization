<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a 55-year-old  tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime minister  a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The new president must be sworn  in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office at the end of his six-year  term.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, said Tuesday  that Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member Parliament  at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In another formality before the election,  the Parliament will amend the constitution, which forbids senior public  servants from running for president.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president  after winning the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>But some fear that a military  man in the nation's highest office could mean a return to the use  of intelligence services to track civilian life _ the case under Fouad  Chehab, the only other army commander to become president, who ruled  from 1958 to 1964.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized  the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said  he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive  post.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, said he  and his party's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member  Parliament elects the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Lebanese Prime Minister  Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a telephone conversation  Monday that was headlined on the front-page of the leftist newspaper  As-Safir.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Lebanese media said the matter was settled Monday at a meeting  in Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President  Hafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller neighbor.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Agreement  among the three officials is essential for the smooth running of the  government.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and  the United States, enjoys wide public and political support at home  and has good relations with Syria.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Since Lahoud has a good relationship with Hariri and Speaker  Nabih Berri, little change was expected in government policy.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The election is a formality  since other candidates have little chance now that Syria has thrown  its weight behind Gen. Lahoud.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Lahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army commander  in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90  civil war, is credited with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese  army and in ending the reign of militias.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Although opposition to Syria's hold on Lebanon's politics is common  among anti-Syrian politicians, it is rare for somebody like Jumblatt  to openly speak against a decision personally cleared by Syrian President  Hafez Assad who keeps 30,000 troops in Lebanon.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>But the choice could not have been  sealed before a final say from Assad, who keeps 30,000 troops in this  country.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Lahoud's  nomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of the next head  of state.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Like Jumblatt, some  in Lebanon fear that a military man as president could mean intelligence  agents will track civilian life just as they did between 1958 and  1964 during the presidency of Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander  to become head of state.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The Hariri camp argues that the president can  poll Parliament members on their choice for prime minister but cannot  accept a mandate to name a person of his choice.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Many hope he will  copy his success with the military in government, which is plagued  by nepotism and waste of public funds.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition  of anonymity, said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because  he did not feel Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in  selecting the premier.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>His word is referred to in the Beirut media as ``the password.''</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  the prime minister's decision to bow out came because he did not feel  Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in selecting the premier.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The new president must be sworn in on  Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office after a six-year term.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Lahoud's nomination complies  with a tradition that the president be a Maronite Christian, the prime  minister a Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>A total of  113 deputies voted for the amendment and four deputies against, including  the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a presidential aspirant.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Lebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratified a constitutional amendment  to clear the way for the election of the army's commander, Gen. Emile  Lahoud, as president.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Lahoud is  virtually assured of the job: the prime minister and the parliament  speaker first approved Lahoud, who then won the all-important backing  of Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Jumblatt  said ``there is adequate political diversity and competition in the  country,'' implying that choosing a military man for president was  unnecessary.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Hariri is still the front-runner  to form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted  sources as saying that Hariri was ``outraged'' that only 62 of the  128 members in Parliament declared their support for him during a  meeting with Lahoud Friday.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining  tactic, since he remains the front-runner for the premiership, the  apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's  economic stability as it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war.</a>
