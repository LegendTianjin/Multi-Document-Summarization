<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Ms. Boyle, who  is running her first statewide race and has widespread union support,  has raised nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7 million  Voinovich has taken in.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These fund-raising visits have fallen into a pattern since  Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug. 17.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Shimkus' measure  is an example of how members of Congress are spending their time as  they stand idle and wait for Republican leaders to reach agreement  on spending bills with the White House, thus avoiding a government  shutdown and allowing them to go home and campaign for the November  elections.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>After an impromptu shopping trip, during which he was greeted with  shouts of ``We love you,'' Clinton told some donors at the beginning  of an impassioned reprise of his Cleveland speech: ``I didn't even  mind the protesters, that's the American way.''</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In one deft sentence,  he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit for the country's  economic strength, making a compact appeal for both sympathy and support  in an appearance earlier in the day in Cleveland.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As the applause died away, Clinton  continued, ``I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live  with the consequences of our mistakes in life.''</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>By midsummer, the president's  aides were delighted to have persuaded him to condense his fund-raising  remarks to just 10 minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In a precedent widely cited by D'Amato supporters, the organization  endorsed Sen. John F. Kerry, a Democrat, over the Republican challenger,  William Weld, in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, even though Weld's  record on gay rights was considered stronger.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>He added with a chuckle:  ``Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public way.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton said  Friday that he must ``live with the consequences'' of his mistakes,  although he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements  of his presidency and take heart from its possibilities.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Clinton has  stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, but he has  taken to making glancing, at times humble, references to it, before  moving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans'  needs.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Then he flew to Philadelphia to raise half a  million dollars for the Democratic Party.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The president left it to his aides on Friday to respond directly  to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>``Mr. President,  these are your friends here today,'' said Tony George, the host of  the Cleveland event, offering the refrain of those who have played  a similar role.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In Cleveland on Friday,  he spoke for 26 minutes and here on Friday evening he spoke for almost  20 minutes.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>But  party officials who opened this election year with high hopes of recapturing  the House are beginning to worry that Democratic incumbents like Price  and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril  on Election Day.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>``Lovin', touchin', squeezin',''  it read, the words superimposed on a cartoon of the president with  his arm over Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, the Washington Monument beside  them.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The intensity  of the debate surrounding the endorsement underscores the importance  of the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see  defeating D'Amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the  Republicans from gaining 60 seats in the Senate _ enough to stop a  Democratic filibuster.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>``While he has criticized fellow Republicans  in Washington for their intolerance, here at home, his own party's  blatant discrimination is still the order of the day,'' Foreman said.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>That is the case in New York, where Schumer's rating by the Human  Rights Campaign has been consistently better than D'Amato's.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>But the reporters who had gathered  there showed little interest in the shiny train car at the senator's  back.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>But as his troubles have grown and the mid-term elections have approached,  his free-form remarks have become longer.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>``I've never had a president campaign here, and I wouldn't want to  start this time'' although he is eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles,  the president's chief of staff and a popular native son in North Carolina,  to stump with him here this Sunday.)</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The move angered gay  Republicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that  the group is biased toward Democrats.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Both  men, however, have angered advocates of rights for gay people by voting  for legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>But in Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenging  Mrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking a  more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he  notes as often as he can that ``Julia votes with Clinton almost 100  percent of the time.''</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The danger  for Senate candidates is that with impeachment now a real possibility,  the debate may move beyond the president's behavior _ about which  there is little disagreement _ to the more problematic issue of whether  he should be removed from office.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>``There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans get  60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge politically  for the next two years,'' said David Mixner, a close friend of President  Clinton's who is gay.</a>
