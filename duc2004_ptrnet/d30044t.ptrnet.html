<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Turkey has asked for his extradition  and Ocalan has asked for political asylum.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Some believe that without  Ocalan, who ruled some 10,000 loyal rebels with an iron fist, his  Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, will be left in disarray.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984,  mainly focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also  carrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``If the  head is dethroned, the rebellion gets a mortal blow,'' said Cengiz  Candar who has been following the Kurdish insurgency for daily Sabah.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast  faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder  and leader.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>His presence in Europe could also  be a blessing in disguise for the group, forcing the PKK to transform  itself from a rebel army into a political movement.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Turkish military claims it has made  important battlefield gains and captured the PKK's second-in-command  this year.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>But Ocalan has been absent from the battlefield for at least a month,  and others contend that the PKK is capable of operating without him.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's  international airport Thursday.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>``Let us not fall into false expectations that this will be the end  of the PKK.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The PKK has already been acting like a headless monster  for too long,'' said Ilnur Cevik of the English-language Turkish Daily  News.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Close to  37,000 people died in the conflict.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Within hours of the PKK leader's arrest,  Turkey requested his extradition to face a number of terrorism-related  charges, which could carry the death penalty.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria,  which appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened  to attack it.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>He turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding  wide support among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>``If Italy  continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday it will be opening  its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling  of brawls that broke out among the Kurdish demonstrators in Rome on  Saturday.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened  opposition in Italy to his extradition.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>If Italy sends the Kurd leader back to Turkey, ``he'll be tortured  for certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the  singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Kurds arrived  from Germany and France to show solidarity with the rebel leader and  a Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched a hunger strike.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>He criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who  reportedly said Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>In Italy, Dini told reporters in the city of Trento that  the government would decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a ``clear  and responsible manner.''</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling Turkey's border  with Iraq have also grown lukewarm.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Kurds came to  Rome by bus and car from across Western Europe for a 1,500-strong  protest outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed held  under tight security.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>There is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and if  the movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under more  pressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority rights.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Turkey stepped up the pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured  Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting  him asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.''</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>In Rome,  1,500 Kurds massed for a second day of demonstrations outside the  military hospital where Ocalan is believed to be held.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Ocalan faces the death  penalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened opposition in Italy  to his extradition.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>If Italy sends Ocalan back to Turkey, ``he'll  be tortured for certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter  among the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Kurdish politicians have been jailed and  groups banned on charges of supporting the PKK.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport  on Thursday as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he  had sought asylum after recently fleeing his hideout in Syria.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>While living  in Damacus, he increased his meetings with European deputies.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>In Turkey, four Kurdish  prison inmates were in critical condition after setting themselves  on fire to protest Ocalan's arrest, the independent Human Rights Association  said.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>This  may be the PKK's best option.</a>
