<s id="s0">GCHQ and European spy agencies worked together on mass surveillance</s>
<s id="s1">The German , French , Spanish and Swedish intelligence services have all developed methods of mass surveillance of internet and phone traffic over the past five years in close partnership with Britain &apos;s GCHQ eavesdropping agency . </s>
<s id="s2">The bulk monitoring is carried out through direct taps into fibre optic cables and the development of covert relationships with telecommunications companies . </s>
<s id="s3">A loose but growing eavesdropping alliance has allowed intelligence agencies from one country to cultivate ties with corporations from another to facilitate the trawling of the web , according to GCHQ documents leaked by the former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden . </s>
<s id="s4">The files also make clear that GCHQ played a leading role in advising its European counterparts how to work around national laws intended to restrict the surveillance power of intelligence agencies . </s>
<s id="s5">The German , French and Spanish governments have reacted angrily to reports based on National Security Agency ( NSA ) files leaked by Snowden since June , revealing the interception of communications by tens of millions of their citizens each month . </s>
<s id="s6">US intelligence officials have insisted the mass monitoring was carried out by the security agencies in the countries involved and shared with the US. </s>
<s id="s7">The US director of national intelligence , James Clapper , suggested to Congress on Tuesday that European governments &apos; professed outrage at the reports was at least partly hypocritical . </s>
<s id="s8">&quot; Some of this reminds me of the classic movie Casablanca : &apos; My God , there &apos;s gambling going on here , &apos; &quot; he said . </s>
<s id="s9">Sweden , which passed a law in 2008 allowing its intelligence agency to monitor cross-border email and phone communications without a court order , has been relatively muted in its response . </s>
<s id="s10">The German government , however , has expressed disbelief and fury at the revelations from the Snowden documents , including the fact that the NSA monitored Angela Merkel &apos;s mobile phone calls . </s>
<s id="s11">After the Guardian revealed the existence of GCHQ &apos;s Tempora programme , in which the electronic intelligence agency tapped directly into the transatlantic fibre optic cables to carry out bulk surveillance , the German justice minister , Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger , said it sounded &quot;like a Hollywood nightmare &quot; , and warned the UK government that free and democratic societies could not flourish when states shielded their actions in &quot; a veil of secrecy&quot; . </s>
<s id="s12">However , in a country-by-country survey of its European partners , GCHQ officials expressed admiration for the technical capabilities of German intelligence to do the same thing . </s>
<s id="s13">The survey in 2008 , when Tempora was being tested , said the Federal Intelligence Service ( BND) , had &quot;huge technological potential and good access to the heart of the internet – they are already seeing some bearers running at 40Gbps and 100Gbps &quot; . </s>
<s id="s14">Bearers is the GCHQ term for the fibre optic cables , and gigabits per second ( Gbps ) measures the speed at which data runs through them . </s>
<s id="s15">Four years after that report , GCHQ was still only able to monitor 10 Gbps cables , but looked forward to tap new 100 Gbps bearers eventually . </s>
<s id="s16">Hence the admiration for the BND. </s>
<s id="s17">The document also makes clear that British intelligence agencies were helping their German counterparts change or bypass laws that restricted their ability to use their advanced surveillance technology . </s>
<s id="s18">&quot; We have been assisting the BND ( along with SIS [Secret Intelligence Service ] and Security Service ) in making the case for reform or reinterpretation of the very restrictive interception legislation in Germany , &quot; it says . </s>
<s id="s19">The country-by-country survey , which in places reads somewhat like a school report , also hands out high marks to the GCHQ &apos;s French partner , the General Directorate for External Security ( DGSE) . </s>
<s id="s20">But in this case it is suggested that the DGSE &apos;s comparative advantage is its relationship with an unnamed telecommunications company , a relationship GCHQ hoped to leverage for its own operations . </s>
<s id="s21">&quot;DGSE are a highly motivated , technically competent partner , who have shown great willingness to engage on IP [internet protocol ] issues , and to work with GCHQ on a &quot; cooperate and share &quot; basis . </s>
<s id="s22">&quot; Noting that the Cheltenham-based electronic intelligence agency had trained DGSE technicians on &quot;multi-disciplinary internet operations &quot; , the document says : &quot; We have made contact with the DGSE &apos;s main industry partner , who has some innovative approaches to some internet challenges , raising the potential for GCHQ to make use of this company in the protocol development arena . </s>
<s id="s23">&quot; GCHQ went on to host a major conference with its French partner on joint internet-monitoring initiatives in March 2009 and four months later reported on shared efforts on what had become by then GCHQ &apos;s biggest challenge – continuing to carry out bulk surveillance , despite the spread of commercial online encryption , by breaking that encryption . </s>
<s id="s24">&quot; Very friendly crypt meeting with DGSE in July , &quot; British officials reported . </s>
<s id="s25">The French were &quot; clearly very keen to provide presentations on their work which included cipher detection in high-speed bearers . </s>
<s id="s26">GCHQ&apos;s   challenge is to ensure that we have enough UK capability to support a longer term crypt relationship . </s>
<s id="s27">&quot; In the case of the Spanish intelligence agency , the National Intelligence Centre ( CNI) , the key to mass internet surveillance , at least back in 2008 , was the Spaniards &apos; ties to a British telecommunications company ( again unnamed . </s>
<s id="s28">Corporate relations are among the most strictly guarded secrets in the intelligence community ) . </s>
<s id="s29">That was giving them &quot;fresh opportunities and uncovering some surprising results . </s>
<s id="s30">&quot;GCHQ has not yet engaged with CNI formally on IP exploitation , but the CNI have been making great strides through their relationship with a UK commercial partner . </s>
<s id="s31">GCHQ and the commercial partner have been able to coordinate their approach . </s>
<s id="s32">The commercial partner has provided the CNI some equipment whilst keeping us informed , enabling us to invite the CNI across for IP-focused discussions this autumn , &quot; the report said . </s>
<s id="s33">It concluded that GCHQ &quot;have found a very capable counterpart in CNI , particularly in the field of Covert Internet Ops &quot; . </s>
<s id="s34">GCHQ was clearly delighted in 2008 when the Swedish parliament passed a bitterly contested law allowing the country &apos;s National Defence Radio Establishment ( FRA ) to conduct Tempora-like operations on fibre optic cables . </s>
<s id="s35">The British agency also claimed some credit for the success . </s>
<s id="s36">&quot;FRA have obtained a … probe to use as a test-bed and we expect them to make rapid progress in IP exploitation following the law change , &quot; the country assessment said . </s>
<s id="s37">&quot;GCHQ has already provided a lot of advice and guidance on these issues and we are standing by to assist the FRA further once they have developed a plan for taking the work forwards . </s>
<s id="s38">&quot; The following year , GCHQ held a conference with its Swedish counterpart &quot; for discussions on the implications of the new legislation being rolled out &quot; and hailed as &quot; a success in Sweden &quot; the news that FRA &quot;have finally found a pragmatic solution to enable release of intelligence to SAEPO [the internal Swedish security service . </s>
<s id="s39">] &quot; GCHQ also maintains strong relations with the two main Dutch intelligence agencies , the external MIVD and the internal security service , the AIVD. </s>
<s id="s40">&quot; Both agencies are small , by UK standards , but are technically competent and highly motivated , &quot; British officials reported . </s>
<s id="s41">Once again , GCHQ was on hand in 2008 for help in dealing with legal constraints . </s>
<s id="s42">&quot; The AIVD have just completed a review of how they intend to tackle the challenges posed by the internet – GCHQ has provided input and advice to this report , &quot; the country assessment said . </s>
<s id="s43">&quot; The Dutch have some legislative issues that they need to work through before their legal environment would allow them to operate in the way that GCHQ does . </s>
<s id="s44">We are providing legal advice on how we have tackled some of these issues to Dutch lawyers . </s>
<s id="s45">&quot; In the score-card of European allies , it appears to be the Italians who come off the worse . </s>
<s id="s46">GCHQ expresses frustration with the internal friction between Italian agencies and the legal limits on their activities . </s>
<s id="s47">&quot;GCHQ has had some CT [counter-terrorism ] and internet-focused discussions with both the foreign intelligence agency ( AISE ) and the security service ( AISI) , but has found the Italian intelligence community to be fractured and unable/unwilling to cooperate with one another , &quot; the report said . </s>
<s id="s48">A follow-up bulletin six months later noted that GCHQ was &quot;awaiting a response from AIS I on a recent proposal for cooperation – the Italians had seemed keen , but legal obstacles may have been hindering their ability to commit . </s>
<s id="s49">&quot; It is clear from the Snowden documents that GCHQ has become Europe &apos;s intelligence hub in the internet age , and not just because of its success in creating a legally permissive environment for its operations . </s>
<s id="s50">Britain &apos;s location as the European gateway for many transatlantic cables , and its privileged relationship with the NSA has made GCHQ an essential partner for European agencies . </s>
<s id="s51">The documents show British officials frequently lobbying the NSA on sharing of data with the Europeans and haggling over its security classification so it can be more widely disseminated . </s>
<s id="s52">In the intelligence world , far more than it managed in diplomacy , Britain has made itself an indispensable bridge between America and Europe &apos;s spies . </s>
