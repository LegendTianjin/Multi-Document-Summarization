<s id="s0">G7 presses Vladimir Putin to pursue peaceful end to Ukraine crisis</s>
<s id="s1">Heads of the G7 leading industrial nations , chaired by David Cameron , on Wednesday called on Vladimir Putin to engage with Ukraine &apos;s incoming President Petro Poroshenko , but stopped short of triggering fresh sanctions against Russia at a curtailed two-day summit in Brussels . </s>
<s id="s2">The group is keeping its options open , saying it is willing to escalate sanctions if Russia fails to engage in a peaceful resolution of the crisis . </s>
<s id="s3">The G7 leaders – many of whom are due to see the Russian president individually later this week about the D-day commemorations in Normandy – are likely to impress on Putin to meet Poroshenko to open a dialogue on the kind of federal structure Ukraine might develop , as well as future trade relations . </s>
<s id="s4">Cameron &apos;s spokeswoman said : &quot; The Ukrainian elections last week had given a clear mandate , and we will work with the new Ukrainian president . </s>
<s id="s5">&quot; She added there was no sign yet that Russia was using its influence to rein in the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine . </s>
<s id="s6">Russia sought an emergency meeting of the UN security council this week to call for a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and the introduction of humanitarian corridors for refugees from Ukraine into Russia . </s>
<s id="s7">The G7 statement described the Russian annexation of Crimea as illegal , stating : &quot; We are united in condemning the Russian Federation &apos;s continuing violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine &quot; . </s>
<s id="s8">It also condemned &quot; the use of energy supplies as a means of political coercion &quot; and called for energy security and the diversification of supplies to be &quot;at the centre of our collective agenda&quot; . </s>
<s id="s9">Putin had been due to chair a full meeting of the G8 in Russia , but the remaining seven nations pulled out in protest at the annexation of Crimea . </s>
<s id="s10">It is the first time Russia has been excluded from the forum in 17 years . </s>
<s id="s11">Putin will meet Cameron on Friday , as well as the German chancellor Angela Merkel , for meetings on the margins of the Normandy D-day commemorations . </s>
<s id="s12">He will also meet President François Hollande in Paris the night before the celebrations , suggesting Putin is hardly being excluded from discussions with western leaders . </s>
<s id="s13">France has been under pressure , mainly from the Poles , to cancel plans to sell Mistral helicopter carriers to Russia . </s>
<s id="s14">Cameron will also hold a one-hour meeting with Obama in Brussels on Thursday , at which they will discuss how Cameron should approach his meeting with Putin , as well as Afghanistan . </s>
<s id="s15">Russia has tried to brush aside the significance of the boycott , describing the G7 as an informal club , but Russia had fought hard to gain entry to the forum and now faces the possibility of long term exclusion . </s>
<s id="s16">In the absence of Russia , Cameron will informally chair discussions on Ukraine on Wednesday night and Merkel will lead the discussions on Thursday . </s>
<s id="s17">The G7 discussions will focus not just on Ukraine , but also on Syria , the global economy , trade and climate change , including European independence from Russian gas supplies . </s>
<s id="s18">The group will again claim that here is no future for Syria with President Assad in charge , as well as rejecting the legitimacy of the elections underway in Syria . </s>
<s id="s19">In a sign of some de-escalation over the Ukrainian crisis , Russia removed 40,000 troops from the Ukrainian border , but there has been no indication it is pulling back the support it is giving to Russian-led disruption in eastern Ukraine . </s>
<s id="s20">It is likely Cameron will use some of his time in Brussels to reiterate his opposition to Jean-Claude Juncker becoming the next European Commission President . </s>
<s id="s21">He yesterday rang Herman Van Rompuy , the President of the European Council , to reiterate his opposition to Juncker , a positionstance that puts him at odds with Merkel , an ally he badly needs in years to come . </s>
