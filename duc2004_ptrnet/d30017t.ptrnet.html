<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>But despite the need for food aid, Ngongi  said the government about a month ago cut the number of counties to  which the WFP has access from 171 to 145, reducing the number of people  who can get aid from 6.7 million to 5.8 million.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Ngongi said he saw malnourished children who were said to be 10 or  11 years old, but appeared to be only 4 or 5 years old.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Although hard figures are not yet available, the prospects for  this year are that ``the harvest will not be any better,'' Ngongi  told reporters in Beijing after visiting North Korea.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Poor harvests, economic collapse and three  years of floods and drought, have produced chronic food shortages  in North Korea and left it heavily reliant on foreign aid.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>North Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain  to feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just  2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program  said.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Fertilizer  is lacking, as is fuel to power tractors and farm machinery, meaning  most planting and harvesting must be done by hand.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year  than last and could be worse, a senior U.N. aid official said Saturday.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Most of those receiving  WFP aid are children aged between 6 months and 6 years.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>``It may be  worse than last year.''</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Ngongi said  the government cited security concerns _ notably the lack of a peace  treaty with its rival South Korea _ for its decision.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>U.S.  officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of North Korea  this summer said 2 million people may have died because of famine.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Ngongi, who spent four  days inspecting WFP relief efforts in North Korea, said people generally  looked better than during a visit last year.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Calling the North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry  of National Unification ordered Hyundai to check thousands of other  cattle being raised at its ranch on the west coast.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The visit has been delayed a month because  of a dispute over 500 cattle donated by Chung Ju-yung, founder of  the Hyundai group, during a trip to the North in June.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The government  said the ban would be temporary, Ngongi added.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>She and other Red Cross  officials saw further ravages of North Korea's slow-motion famine:  electricity supplied to only half the capital, Pyongyang, at a time;  the elderly looking swollen, a sign of long-term hunger; a generation  of children stunted, with 10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds and  5-year-olds like 2-year-olds.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister  Kang In-duk said North Korea sent a letter to Hyundai last week, saying  that ``the misunderstanding with the southern authorities on the issue  of the dead cattle is cleared.''</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>And while some have surmised that the closed counties  might harbor pockets of death and devastation, he said he accepted  North Korea's explanation that they had been excluded from some areas  for national security reasons.</a>
