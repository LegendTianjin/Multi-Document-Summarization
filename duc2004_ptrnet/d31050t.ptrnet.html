<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Like Thursday's trials,  both of which proceeded with no defense attorneys because prospective  lawyers had been warned off by police or detained, Monday's proceeding  showed that in cases involving security issues, police and courts  could write their own rules.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By the time the ink is dry, Blair should be landing in Beijing on  Tuesday morning for the first visit by a British prime minister in  seven years.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Qin said  a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan  accused him of engaging in illegal activities.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The police came soon  after he returned home.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Qin Yongmin's latest  run-in with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in  a week to legally register a human rights monitoring group.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty  and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent  human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>``As I'm sending this statement, the Wuhan  Public Security Bureau is again taking me away,'' Qin said in a hastily  scrawled message on the bottom of the typed statement faxed to reporters.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Qin  hoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International  Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authorities  don't observe the treaty ``we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting  human rights to the last.''</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>But even after China signs, the treaty would not come  into force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach reservations  effectively nullifying some provisions.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Qin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned for about three  hours before being released and threatened with prosecution if he  persisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Blair has vowed to discuss  differences over human rights with Chinese leaders.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>``I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at  the same time sending people directly from prison into exile is a  type of human rights violation and persecution,'' Liu Qing said in  a telephone interview from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The treaty is supposed to guarantee freedoms of speech  and assembly.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>China plans to sign the International  Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In an open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leaders  say they respect human rights principles, in law and practice the  government allows rights abuses and persecution of dissidents.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>After 3 1/2 years  in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts  of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian  Air flight, ultimately bound for New York, his mother and brother  said.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Beijing police Sunday detained one of Xu's China  Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attending  the trial, Xu's wife said.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has long been among China's  harshest critics in Congress, said the prison sentences handed out  to Xu and Wang were ``the clearest demonstration'' since the president's  visit to China last summer of Beijing's ``true intentions regarding  human rights.''</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>In the only official comment on the release, the  Xinhua News Agency reported that judicial departments took into account  Liu's health and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole  for medical treatment.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Thousands  of political prisoners are believed to remain in Chinese prisons,  labor camps or detention centers, said the letter, a copy of which  was released by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights  and Democratic Movement in China.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Under the law, defendants  also have the right to a lawyer of their choice, but Xu was assigned  a lawyer by the court late last week.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>His more than 3 1/2 years in prisons  and labor camps was a sad illustration of the way China's Communist  Party rulers punish people they deem a threat.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>His visit has  drawn appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group  urging him to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>While condemning  the prison sentences, Foley and other American officials were careful  to note the administration's assessment that there had been progress  in human rights in China, some of it linked to Clinton's meeting in  Beijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The letter called for the release  of Shi Binhai, a journalist who compiled a popular book on political  change; Fang Jue, a businessman who called openly for political reform;  and other imprisoned activists.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was  free, human rights groups decried the Chinese government's timing  as manipulative.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Critics of the administration's China policy noted that the long prison  sentences were handed out less than a week after Jiang delivered a  pointed speech in Beijing in which he made clear that China's economic  reforms were not a prelude to Western-style democracy.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Labor camp officials  later extended Liu's sentence by a year for trying to escape, a charge  Chu claimed was fabricated.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>According to the criminal procedure law,  defendants are to be notified at least 10 days before a trial, but  Xu was told only four days ago that his trial would be Monday.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>1 Intermediate People's  Court, police detained two of Xu's colleagues Sunday and kept watch  on the homes of at least two others, friends and a Hong Kong-based  rights group reported.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>But in a decision that was clearly  preordained, the court declared Xu guilty and sentenced him to spend  what may be much of the rest of his life in prison.</a>
